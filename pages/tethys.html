                        Tethys is the fifth largest <a href="satellites-of-saturn.html">satellite of Saturn</a>.
                        It is one of the four <a href="natural-satellite.html">moons</a> discovered by Giovanni Cassini and is named after the Greek mythological Titaness of the same name.
                        It is an icy body and has the lowest density of any terrestial planetary body, lower than even liquid water.
                        It also has one of the biggest craters on planetary bodies in the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a> - Odysseus.
                        Apart from it, Ithaca Chasma is another significant feature crossing the surface.
                        Just like <a href="dione.html">Dione</a>, Tethys has two <a href="trojan.html">trojan</a> moons that orbit <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a> - Telesto and Calypso.

                    In 1684, Giovanni Domenico Cassini discovered two moons - Dione and Tethys.
                    He also made two earlier discoveries at the Paris Observatory - <a href="rhea.html">Rhea</a> and <a href="iapetus.html">Iapetus</a>,

                    Tethys is named after the Titaness from Greek mythology, mother of the river gods and the three thousand Oceanids.
                    Initially, Cassini called the four moons he discovered Sidera Lodoicea ("the stars of Louis") in honour of Louis XIV.
                    Later, these four, along with Titan, were numbered I through V in order from closest to most distant, and later were updated when  <a href="mimas.html">Mimas</a>, <a href="enceladus.html">Enceladus</a>, and <a href="hyperion.html">Hyperion</a> were discovered.
                    John Herschel was the first to suggest naming satellites of Saturn after Titans and Giants, since Cronus (Greek analogue of the Roman Saturn) is their leader.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Tethys is the 15th moon closest to Saturn along with two other moons.
                    These two - Telesto and Calypso - are trojans and orbit near the L4 and L5 points of Tethys respectively.
                    The three have a semi-major axis of 295 thousand kilometers.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    It takes 45 hours for Tethys to complete one orbit around Saturn.
                    This is also the time for one rotation since it is also tidally locked.
                    Tethys has an inclination of 1.1Â° and an eccentricity of  0.001, making its orbit close to a circle.
                    Tethys is also in a 1:2 resonance with Mimas.

                    Tethys is the fifth largest moon of Saturn.
                    It has a mean diameter of 1062.2 km.

                        Tethys has a density of 0.98 g/cm^3, making it the lowest of all the terrestrial planetary mass objects.
                        It is the only one of them with a lower density than liquid water.
                        This suggests a composition of a lot of ice and very low amount of rock.
                        If differentiated into a core and a mantle, the rocky core would be no greater than 290 km in diameter.
                        There is also a possibility of high internal porosity.
                        The existence of a subsurface ocean is unlikely.

                        Tethys has a heavily cratered, highly reflective icy surface, similar to most of the other Saturnian moons.
                        The high albedo indicates a surface of water ice with very little other compounds.
                        Despite this, there are some slight colorations on both the trailing and leading hemispheres seen only with enhanced colors.
                        A brownish spot can be seen on the trailing hemispere.
                        Either the spot is a result of darker particles accumulating compared to icy material from the E ring on the leading hemisphere, or the plasma impacts on that side from Saturn's magnetosphere change the color.
                        On the leading hemisphere can be seen another spot, this time smaller and bluish.
                        Electrons from Saturn's magnetosphere are the most likely culprit this time.
                        A third type of colored features are several red strikes, that could be colored by impurities.

                        The most recognizable feature on the surface of Tethys is the Odysseus crater, which is 450 km in diameter.
                        It is one of the largest impact craters relative to the body's size.
                        Among planetary moons, only the South Pole-Aitken basin on the <a href="moon.html">Moon</a> has a larger relative size.
                        It has eroded significantly, since water ice is volatile and through viscous relaxation the basin has flattened.
                        Several chasms radiate from it, one of which is named Ogygia Chasmata.
                        Other large craters include Melanthius and Penelope.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Ithaca Chasma is another discernable feature, which follows a great circle along the surface of Tethys.
                        It is 100 km wide, 3 km deep and 2,000 km in length. 
                        It is not related to the impact of Odysseus, as it is older.
                        Ithaca Chasma's formation might have occured early in the history of Tethys when the interior cooled down, creating a crack on the surface.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Tethys has been visited by several missions.
                    Pioneer 11 was the first to make a flyby, but no images were made from the 329 kilometers distance.
                    The two Voyager mission sent back the first images of its surface, revealing Ithaca Chasma and Odysseus crater.
                    Cassini was the last mission to Saturn.
                    It made several observations of Tethys, high definition imagery, spectroscopic measurements and more.
