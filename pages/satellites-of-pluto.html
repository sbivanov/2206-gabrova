                    <a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a> is orbited by five known <a href="natural-satellite.html">natural satellites</a> - <a href="charon.html">Charon</a>, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. 
                    Names originate from Greek mythology and are related to the underworld. 
                    They are believed to have formed from the debris of a massive collision between Pluto and another Kuiper Belt object billions of years ago, similar to how <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>’s <a href="moon.html">Moon</a> is thought to have formed. 
                    All moons are moving in nearly circular paths around Pluto, close to the <a href="dwarf-planet.html">dwarf planet</a>’s equatorial plane.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Charon is the biggest of the five satellites and is the only round one.
                    It is named after the ferryman of the underworld.
                    It is so big compared to Pluto, that the barycenter lies outside of it and both objects are tidally locked to each other.
                    For that reason some refer to Pluto and Charon as a binary system.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The four smaller moons - Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra — are much less massive and irregularly shaped, ranging from about 10 to 50 kilometers in their longest dimensions.
                    They orbit Pluto at greater distances than Charon and are thought to have a composition similar to that of Charon.
                    Nix and Hydra, the two bigger ones, were both discovered in 2005.
                    Kerberos and Styx were discovered in 2011 and 2012 respectively when New Horizons visited Pluto.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Charon was discovered by James Christy and Robert Harrington by accident in 1978 when the two were trying to recalculate more precisely Pluto's orbit.
                    The location where Charon was discovered, the U.S. Naval Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, is not far from the Lowell Observatory, where Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto.
                    Christy noticed a bulge appearing on some of the images of Pluto and dissapearing on others, with a period of 6.39 days.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    On May 15th, Hydra and Nix were discovered by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope.
                    During the New Horizons visit, the two other moons were discovered.
                    Kerberos and Styx were confirmed in 2011 and 2012 respectively.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    James Christy first suggested Oz, then the name Charon, derived from his wife Charlene.
                    Christy stuck with that name after realizing it was coincidentally the name of the Greek mythological figure Charon (Χάρων) - the ferryman of the dead and closely associated with the god Hades/Pluto.
                    The only difference between the Charlene nickname and the mythological ferryman was in the pronounciation of the "ch".
                    The other four moons were also named with characters and places from Greek mythology that are connected to the underworld.

                        Charon is the biggest of the five <a href="natural-satellite.html">satellites</a> of <a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a> and is the only round one, with a diameter of about 1,212 kilometers - just over half that of Pluto itself.
                        It was discovered by James Christy and Robert Harrington in 1978 and is named after the ferryman of the underworld.
                        It is so big compared to Pluto, that the barycenter lies outside of it and both objects are tidally locked to each other.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Charon’s surface is a mix of water ice and darker material, with a prominent reddish tholin-covered cap at its north pole (Mordor Macula).
                        The most striking feature is a system of chasms and cliffs that stretch for hundreds of kilometers similar to <a href="miranda.html">Miranda</a>, a moon of <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a>.
                        Unlike Pluto, Charon lacks a substantial atmosphere, though there is evidence of a very thin one.

                        By distance, Hydra is the fifth and outermost moon of Pluto, orbiting beyond Pluto's fourth moon Kerberos.

                        It was discovered along with Pluto's outermost moon Hydra in 2005 and was named after the Greek goddess of the night.
                        Nix is the third moon of Pluto by distance, orbiting between the moons Styx and Kerberos.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In January 2006, the New Horizons mission was launched to exolre the Pluto-Charon system.
                    It took its first images in June 2015, revealing the planetary-like moon and its intriguing surface.
                    Like Pluto, a significant portion of Charon remained in darkness during the flyby.
                    Images with resolutions of up to 330 meters per pixel were returned of Nix and up to 1.1 kilometers per pixel of Hydra.
                    Lower-resolution images were returned of Styx and Kerberos, which do not show any surface features.
