                    469219 Kamoʻoalewa is a <a href="nea.html">near-Earth asteroid</a>, part of the Apollo group.
                    It was discovered in 2016 and is a quasi-satellite of <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>, appearing to orbit like it is a <a href="natural-satellite.html">moon</a> while its orbit is actually affected by the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>.
                    Some suggest it may be lunar ejecta, possibly a fragment from the <a href="moon.html">Moon</a>.
                    Kamoʻoalewa will be the target of the upcoming Tianwen-2 sample return mission by CNSA.

                    Kamoʻoalewa was discovered on 27 April 2016 by the Pan-STARRS <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> survey telescope on Haleakalā, Hawaiʻi.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The name Kamoʻoalewa translates to "the oscillating fragment" from Hawaiʻian, refering to its apparent movement seen from Earth.
                    Kamoʻoalewa also appears as a name in the traditional Kumulipo chant as part of the lineage of deities, part fourteen, line 1816.

                    Kamoʻoalewa is a near-Earth asteroid, part of the Apollo group.
                    It is a quasi-satellite of Earth - it appears to be a moon, but instead it orbits the Sun while very close to Earth.
                    The semi-major axis and orbital period are very close to those of Earth - 1.001 AU and 366 days respectively, though the proper parameters are even closer to Earth's.
                    The perihelion of 0.898 AU and the aphelion of 1.104 AU make it seem like it orbits Earth.
                    Kamoʻoalewa does not come closer than 0.03 AU (or 12.1 lunar distances) to Earth, well outside the region where its gravitationally bound (the Hill sphere).
                    In the distant future, Kamoʻoalewa's orbit could get pertrubed and it will either impact Earth, another body, or even get ejected from the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a>.

                    The eccentricity is 0.103 and the inclination is 7.796°.
                    The rotational period is only 0.467 hours.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Kamoʻoalewa is approximately 41 km in diameter, though a size up to 100 m is also possible.
                    Its shape also remains unknown.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Kamoʻoalewa is possibly a piece of lunar ejecta.
                    However, it is also plausible that it is an S- or L-type asteroid, consisting of silicate rocks.
                    If the first theory is true, Kamoʻoalewa might have originated from the far-side highland region, more precisely the Giordano Bruno crater.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Kamoʻoalewa will be visited by the Tianwen-2 sample collection mission by CNSA in June 2026.
                    It will orbit the asteroid for a year, then collect regolith samples with both touch-and-go (used for <a href="itokawa.html">Itokawa</a>, <a href="ryugu.html">Ryugu</a>, and <a href="bennu.html">Bennu</a>) and anchor-and-attach; the latter method will be used for the first time.
                    After returning a capsule to Earth, it will make a flyby of the periodic <a href="comet.html">comet</a> 311P/PANSTARRS.
