                        As one of the earliest asteroids ever discovered, in 1804 by Karl Harding, it was originally considered a new <a href="planet.html">planet</a>.
                        Juno is one of the largest asteroids, having a mean diameter greater than 200 km.

                    Juno was discovered in 1804 by Karl Harding in Lilienthal, Germany, where he worked in astronomer Johann Schröter's observatory.
                    Karl Harding was part of the so-called "celestial police", which had a goal of compiling more precise <a href="star.html">star</a> catalogues, but later began an organized search for a planet between <a href="mars.html">Mars</a> and <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>.
                    Before Juno, <a href="ceres.html">Ceres</a> and <a href="pallas.html">Pallas</a> were also discovered, which together with several subsequent bodies were all classified as new planets until a new class of "asteroids" was created.

                    Juno is an asteroid in the intermediate asteroid belt.
                    The semi-major axis is 2.67 AU, the perihelion is 1.99 AU, and the aphelion is 3.35 AU.
                    It takes Juno 4.36 years to complete one orbit.
                    The eccentricity is relatively high at 0.256 and the inclination is 12.99°.
                    The rotational period of Juno is 7.21 hours.

                    Juno is not part of any proven collisional family.
                    However, a group of several small asteroids also shares similar orbital elements with Juno.
                    It is possible that this "clump" is comprised of ejected fragments of past cratering events on Juno.

                    Juno has triaxial dimensions of 288 × 250 × 225 km and a mean 254 km diameter.

                    Juno is an S-type asteroid, consisting of silicate (rocky) material, including mafic minerals like pyroxene and olivine.
                    Chondrite meteorites are analogous in composition to Juno.
                    Its surface is relatively bright, which gives it a higher apparent magnitude at a favorable opposition than other larger asteroids.

                    The surface of Juno has been resolved by Earth-based telescopes.
                    It has been revealed that there is a 100 km-wide crater on its surface.
