                        9969 Braille is an <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a>, classified as a <a href="mars.html">Mars</a> crosser.
                        It was discovered in 1992.
                        Braille has a very elongated and irregular shape.
                        NASA's Deep Space 1 mission made a very close flyby of the asteroid.
                        However, malfunctions prevented high resolution images.

                    Braille was discovered in 1992 by astronomers E. F. Helin and K. J. Lawrence at the Palomar Observatory in California.
                    The discovery was part of the Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The asteroid is named after Louis Braille, inventor of the Braille system for the blind.
                    The suggestion was part of a naming contest held by The Planetary Society in 1999.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Braille is a Mars crosser, 2,341 AU from the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>, with a 1.326 AU perihelion and a 3.356 AU aphelion.
                    The orbital period is 3.58 years.
                    The orbit is both highly eccentric (0.433) and inclined (28.999°).
                    Braille is a slow rotator with a rotational period of 226.4 hours, or 9.43 days.
                    Simulations have shown that Braille will become an <a href="earth.html">Earth crosser</a> in 4000 years.

                    Braille has an irregular, elongated shape with triaxial dimensions of 2.1 × 1 × 1 km with a mean diameter of 1.6 km.
                    At the time, it was the smallest asteroid visited by a spacecraft if <a href="ida.html">243 Ida</a>'s <a href="natural-satellite.html">moon</a> Dactyl is not counted.

                    Braille is part of the uncommon Q spectral type, characterized by a high olivine and pyroxene composition.
                    Such asteroids are similar to ordinary chondrites (particularly H ordinary chondrites), which are the most common meteorites on Earth.
                    It is also unusually bright for an asteroid, with an albedo of about 0.34.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Braille was initially the main target for NASA's Deep Space 1 demonstration mission.
                    On 29 July 1999, it flew by just 26 km at its closest and obtained three infrared spectra.
                    However, malfunctions prevented high resolution images and the best shots are at 14 000 km from it.
                    Extension of the Deep Space 1 mission continued with a visit of the comet 19P/Borrelly.
