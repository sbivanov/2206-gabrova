                        152830 Dinkinesh is a sub-kilometer, inner <a href="asteroid-belt.html">main belt</a> <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a>.
                        It was discovered in 1999.
                        It is a binary consisting of a main body and a small <a href="natural-satellite.html">moon</a> that is also a contact binary, named Selam.
                        Dinkinesh was a secondary target of the Lucy mission that is currently on its way to the <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> <a href="trojan.html">trojans</a>.

                    Dinkinesh was discovered on 4 November 1999 by the LINEAR sky survey at Socorro, New Mexico.
                    The satellite Selam was discovered in 2023 during the Lucy flyby.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Dink'inesh is the Amharic name for the Lucy hominid fossils of an Australopithecus Afarensis.
                    In Amharic, the name translates to "you're wonderful".
                    The name of the asteroid was chosen after it was selected as a flyby target of the Lucy space mission, also named after the fossils.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Dinkinesh is located in the inner asteroid belt.
                    The semi-major axis is 2.191 AU, the perihelion is 1.946 AU, and the aphelion is 2.437 AU.
                    It takes Dinkinesh 3.24 years to complete one orbit.
                    The eccentricity is 0.112 and the inclination is 2.094°.
                    The rotational period of Dinkinesh is around 3.74 hours.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Dinkinesh might be a member of the Flora family of asteroids, or it could be a background asteroid.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Dinkinesh measures 790 m in diameter across its equator and a mean diameter of 720 km.
                    The shape of Dinkinesh is similar to a walnut, defined by an equatorial ridge and a perpendicular trough.

                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="Structure">Structure</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Spectroscopic data from the Keck Observatory indicates a transitional Sq-type, with the presence of olivine and pyroxene, typical of Q-type asteroids.
                    In contrast, the Gemini Observatory does not detect the same 1 μm absorption band for those minerals and instead suggests a simple S-type.
                    If both datasets are correct and not due to artifacts, the surface might be unevenly weathered.
                    A rubble pile structure is likely for Dinkinesh.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The surface of Dinkinesh is crossed by a larger equatorial ridge and some smaller ones, as well as a trough going perpendicular to the main ridge.
                    Many craters can also be seen on the surface.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Dinkinesh has one natural satellite - Selam.
                        It is named after another fossil of the same species as Lucy.
                        Selam translates to "peace" from Amharic.
                        Selam orbits 3.1 km away from Dinkinesh.

                        This is the first time a contact binary moon has been discovered.
                        Selam is made of two 200 m lobes and has a ridge running through it, though it is not equatorial.

                    On 1 November 2023, the Lucy spacecraft made a flyby of Dinkinesh from a distance of 425 km.
                    This was the first asteroid that Lucy visited and is the smallest main belt asteroid visited so far.
                    It returned several images and lightcurves, and discovered its satellite Selam.
                    Lucy then continued with its mission, making a gravity assist flyby of <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> before heading towards asteroid <a href="donaldjohanson.html">Donaldjohanson</a> and the Greek camp of Jupiter.
