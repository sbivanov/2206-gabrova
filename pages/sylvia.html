                        87 Sylvia is an outer <a href="asteroid-belt.html">main belt</a> <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a>, part of the <a href="cybele.html">Cybele</a> group.
                        It was discovered in 1866.
                        Sylvia is one of the largest asteroids, having a mean diameter greater than 200 km.
                        Two <a href="natural-satellite.html">moons</a> were discovered around Sylvia and are named Romulus and Remus, making it the first asteroid with multiple satellites.

                    Sylvia is an asteroid in the outer asteroid belt.
                    The semi-major axis is 3.48 AU, the perihelion is 3.15 AU, and the aphelion is 3.81 AU.
                    It takes Sylvia 6.5 years to complete one orbit.
                    The eccentricity is 0.094 and the inclination is 10.9°.
                    The rotational period of Sylvia is 5.18 hours.

                    Sylvia is part of the Cybele group, located in the outermost regions of the asteroid belt.
                    Furthermore, it is also the parent body of the Sylvia family, consisting of 191 known members.

                    Two moons were discovered around Sylvia and are named Romulus and Remus, making it the first asteroid with multiple satellites.
                    They are most likely a result from the same collision that has created the Sylvia family.
                    Remus is the smaller of the two and orbits closer, with a 10 km radius, while the larger Romulus has a diameter of 27,1 km.
