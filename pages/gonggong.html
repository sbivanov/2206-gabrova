                        Gonggong is a large <a href="tno.html">trans-Neptunian object</a> and a likely <a href="dwarf-planet.html">dwarf planet</a>.
                        It is the largest known TNO not recognised as a dwarf planet by the IAU.
                        It is named after a Chinese water god with a human head and a serpent body.
                        It is located in the scattered disc and is one of the farthest known objects in the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a>.

                        Gonggong's surface is red from the presence of tholins, similarly to <a href="makemake.html">Makemake</a>.
                        Contrary to Makemake, Gonggong is not as bright.
                        It has a single <a href="natural-satellite.html">natural satellite</a> - Xiangliu.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Gonggong was discovered by astronomers Megan Schwamb, Michael Brown and David Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory on 17 July 2007.
                    This discovery was part of the Palomar Distant Solar System Survey along 24 other distant minor planets.
                    Schwamb was a graduate student of Brown and the discovery was part of her doctoral thesis.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    A moon named Xiangliu was discovered around Gonggong in September 2010.

                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Name">Name</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Gonggong is named after a water god in Chinese mythology, responsible for floods on <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> before being sent into exile.
                    He has a serpent body and a red head, which ties with the red appearance.
                    Originally, it was refered to by Brown as "Snow White", expecting the object to be white in color due to the abundance of water ice.
                    After enough analysis that showed Gonggong is much larger than previously thought and that it is actually very red, the new name was approved by Brown.
                    Gonggong has a minor planet number of 225088 and had a provisional name 2007 OR10.

                    Gonggong is a trans-Neptunian object, located in the scattered disc.
                    It has a semi-major axis of 66.9 AU, with a perihelion and an aphelion of 33.2 and 100.6 AU respectively.
                    At the time of its discovery, Gonggong was one of the most distant known objects in the Solar System.
                    It takes 547.1 years to complete one orbit around the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>.
                    It is resonant with <a href=".html">Neptune</a> in a 3:10 ratio.
                    It has both high inclination (30.9°) and eccentricity (0.5), typical of the scattered disc.
                    Gonggong completes one rotation every 22.4 hours.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Gonggong is one of the largest TNOs and is a likely dwarf planet.
                    Latest radiometric measurements suggest a mean diameter at around 1,230 km, which would mean it is smaller than Makemake.
                    Earlier data has shown it to be as big as 1,535 km, but is now unlikely because of the newly calculated mass.
                    Gonggong has yet to occult a <a href="star.html">star</a>.

                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="Structure">Structure</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Gonggong is likely differentiated and gravitationally round.
                    The densitiy is estimated to be 1.74 and the composition is thus 70% rock and 30% ice.
                    If the earlier size estimates are to be true, Gonggoong would have a density below that of water, which is highly unlikely
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    It is heavy enough to retain light volatiles like methane, ammonia, carbon monoxide and even nitrogen, similar to the slightly smaller <a href="quaoar.html">Quaoar</a>.
                    From 2022 JWST observations, Gonggong's spectrum shows several features of different ices, like water, ethane, complex organics, and CO2, but no methane.
                    The significant amount of water ice suggests a period of cryovolcanic activity.
                    However, it is significantly red, which is unexpected for a water ice-rich object like Gonggong.
                    It also has a lower albedo than Makemake, another red dwarf planet, which has a likely younger surface.
                    The red color is the result of tholins, which have formed from methane and nitrogen under cosmic radiation.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Although spectroscopic data does not show strong evidence for methane, it can be deducted from the rich in tholins surface.
                    Since Gonggong's perihelion comes relatively close to the Sun, part of it could sublimate and form a tenuous atmosphere.
                    The size of Gonggong is large enough to retain part of that atmosphere, with substances like nitrogen likely already depleted.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Gonggong has one satellite - Xiangliu.
                    It explains why Gonggong is an unusually slow rotator.
                    It is approximately 100 km in diameter and completes an orbit every 25 days.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Gonggong has not been visited by any spacecraft.
                    A flyby mission could take just under 25 years using a <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> gravity assist, based on a launch date of 2030 or 2031.
                    Gonggong would be approximately 95 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives.
