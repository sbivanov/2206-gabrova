                        253 Mathilde is an <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> from the intermediate <a href="asteroid-belt.html">asteroid belt</a>.
                        It was discovered in 1885 by Johann Palisa.
                        Mathilde is a slow rotator, taking 17.4 days to complete one rotation.
                        It is a carbonaceous asteroid with a surface defined by several large craters the size of Mathilde's radius.
                        The asteroid was a secondary target of the NEAR Shoemaker mission, which later visited, orbited and landed on the <a href="nea.html">near-Eath asteroid</a> <a href="eros.html">Eros</a>.

                    Mathilde is named after the vice director of the Paris Observatory Moritz Loewy's wife.
                    The name was given by V. A. Lebeuf of the same observatory, who helped compute the orbital parameters.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Mathilde is located in the intermediate asteroid belt at 2.648 AU from the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>, with a 1.947 AU perihelion and a 3.350 AU aphelion.
                    The orbital period is 4.31 years.
                    The orbit is relatively eccentric at 0.265 and the inclination is 6.743°.
                    Mathilde's rotational period is 17.4 days, making it a slow rotator.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Mathilde has triaxial measurements of 66 × 48 × 46 km and a mean diameter of 52.8 km.
                    It has a slightly elongated shape that is severly deformed by a few large craters.
                    At the time of the NEAR flyby, it was the largest asteroid visited by a spacecraft.
                </p>
                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="Structure">Structure</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The spectral class of Mathilde is C-type, characterized by a carbonaceous composition that gives the asteroid a dark color.
                    It is likely that Mathilde corresponds to CI1 and CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.
                    The density is only 1.3 g/cm^3, likely due to high porosity of up to 50%.
                    The hollow interior could explain why Mathilde survived several large impacts, as that structure isolates shock waves.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The most striking features on the surface of Mathilde are the four craters Karoo, Ishikari, Damodar, and Kuznetsk.
                    Their diameters are 33,4, 29.3, 28.7 and 28.5 km respectively, all greater than Mathilde's mean diameter.
                    Craters of this size are unusual, as one such could have destroyed Mathilde, let alone four.
                    Several scarps can also be seen on the surface, including an unnamed 20 km long one.
                    For that reason it is unlikely that Mathilde is a rubber pile despite the high porosity.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Mathilde was the third asteroid visited by a spacecraft.
                    The flyby would occur on 27 June 1997, when the NEAR Shoemake probe was on its way to its main destination - Eros.
                    The slow rotation of the asteroid prevented the probe to capture the entirety of its surface, but the large craters were still evident.
