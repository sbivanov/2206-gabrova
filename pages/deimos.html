                        Deimos is the second largest <a href="natural-satellite.html">moon</a> of <a href="mars.html">Mars</a>.
                        It is the smaller and the more distant from Mars of <a href="satellites-of-mars.html">the two</a>.
                        The surface has less unique features than <a href="phobos.html">Phobos</a> and is marked by a few impact craters.
                        Its smoother appearance is cause by partial filling of some of its craters.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 1877, astronomer Asaph Hall was searching for moons on Mars.
                    He was inspired by previous speculations that there were two satellites orbiting Mars.
                    He was on the verge of giving up when in August he discovered Deimos.
                    Six days later, he found the second moon - Phobos.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Deimos is named after the Greek son of Ares, personifications of terror. 
                    The name was suggested by the british chemist Henry Madan.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Deimos orbits around Mars every 1 day and 6 hours.
                    It is tidally locked to Mars and is always facing the same side.
                    It orbits Mars much closer than the <a href="moon.html">Moon</a> does around <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> at 23,463km.
                    The eccentricity of Deimos is nearly zero and the inclination is 0.9°.

                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Origin">Origin</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The origin of Deimos is still contested.
                    One theory suggests that the two Martian moons were brought to a Mars orbit from the asteroid belt.
                    They share the same properties as C (carbonaceous) and D-type (dark) <a href="asteroid.html">asteroids</a> in terms of albedo and spectra.
                    However, they both have relatively regular orbits that must have been stabilized by Mars.
                    Another theory is that they formed from the collision that shaped the Northern Polar Basin on Mars, similar to the Moon's origin.
                    Several possibilities exist, like coalescing from a Martian ring, or being a surviving piece of that event.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Deimos has triaxial dimensions of 16.1 km × 11.8 km × 10.2 km, making it smaller than Phobos.
                    The mean radius is 12.54 km.

                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="Structure">Structure</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Deimos has a similar composition to that of Phobos in that it corresponds to C and D-type asteroids.
                    It is a rocky body rich in carbonaceous material (graphite, carbonates, organic elements).
                    This carbon-rich material gives Deimos its dark appearance.
                    Of the two moons, it is the darker one.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Deimos is significantly smoother than Phobos in appearance.
                    This is likely due to the filling of the craters with regolith.
                    Only two craters have received names - Voltaire and Swift.

                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Exploration">Exploration</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Deimos was explored by most of the missions to Mars, where it was a secondary target.
                    Other missions that made flybys of Mars for acceleration (or deacceleration) also made close approaches to it, but without studying it.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Unlike Phobos, Deimos did not have dedicated missions.
                    JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration is a planned Phobos and Deimos sample return mission, expected to launch in 2026.
