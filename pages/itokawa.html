                        25143 Itokawa is a sub-kilometer <a href="nea.html">near-Earth asteroid</a> part of the Apollo group and is potentially hazardous.
                        Itokawa became the first <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> from which samples were captured and brought to <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> for analysis after Hayabusa gathered dust particles from its surface.
                        It is also the smallest asteroid visited by a spacecraft so far, if the <a href="natural-satellite.html">moon</a> of <a href="didymos.html">Didymos</a> is not counted.
                        The asteroid is a rubber pile made up of many fragments, as well as dust ponds that fill up depressions.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Itokawa was discovered in September 1998 by the Lincoln Laboratory Near-Earth Asteroid Research Team at Socorro, New Mexico.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Itokawa is named after Hideo Itokawa, Japanese aerospace engineer who initiated Japan's first launch tests of the solid rocket series.
                    The name was selected after the asteroid was chosen as the target of Hayabusa 1.

                    Itokawa is a near-Earth asteroid part of the Apollo group and a <a href="mars.html">Mars</a> crosser with a 1.32 AU semi major axis, a 0.95 AU perihelion and a 1.70 AU aphelion.
                    Itokawa completes one orbit every 1.52 years.
                    The eccentricity is 0.28 and the inclination is 1.62°.
                    The rotational period is around 12.1 hours.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Itokawa is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid.
                    The Earth minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) is 0.0131 AU, or 5.1 lunar distances.
                    In other words, there is no immediate risk from a collision with Itokawa in the near future,

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Itokawa has dimensios of 535 m × 294 m × 209 m, or a mean 330 m diameter.
                    This makes Itokawa the smallest individual asteroid visited to date, although the moon of Didymos, Dimorphos, is smaller. 
                    Itokawa has an elongated, peanut-like shape, comprised of two lobes.

                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="Structure">Structure</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Itokawa is an S-class asteroid, consisting of silicate rocks, including the minerals olivine and pyroxene, and is similar to LL chondrites.
                    The asteroid is an example of a rubber pile made up of fragments bound up by gravitational forces.
                    These fragments are young and are likely from the interior of a large body that has broken up.
                    The two lobes of Itokawa also have different densities.
                    While the larger one has a density of 1.8 g/cm^3, the smaller is denser at 2.9 g/cm^3.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Analsis of the samples retrieved by the Hayabusa mission have shown the presence of water with hydrogen isotope levels corresponding with inner <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a> and carbonaceous chondrite water isotope levels.
                    The hydrated nature of S-type asteroids like Itokawa could have contributed to the availability of water on Earth
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Due to its small size, the surface of Itokawa is dominated by rock fragments.
                    The largest crater, Miyabaru, roughly 90 m in diameter, is not well-defined.
                    More notable features are dust ponds, which appear smoother than other surfaces.
                    The largest such region is MUSES-C Regio, between the two lobes, around 230 meters in area.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Itokawa has been the target of the Hayabusa sample return mission by JAXA, the Japanese space agency,
                    In September 2005, the probe reached its destination, orbiting the Sun within 7 km of the asteroid.
                    After a failed attempt, Hayabusa made a second landing and successfully collected 1500 grains off the surface of Itokawa.
                    The probe returned the capsule to Earth for further studies, which reported H2O molecules and OH groups.
