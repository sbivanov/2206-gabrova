                    An interstellar object is an astronomical objects that move in the interstellar medium instead of being bound to a <a href="star.html">star</a>.
                    Such objects can also approach a star and temporarily orbit it in a hyperbolic trajectory.
                    In that case, it can also be called an interstellar interloper.
                    Stars themselves are not considered interstellar objects.
                    In regards to the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a>, the term is used for an object that has entered the system.

                    The first interstellar objects to be discovered were rogue planets once ejected from their hosting star system.
                    In recent years, several objects with interstellar origins were detected in the Solar System.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Most interstellar objects are likely ejected from their home star systems due to gravitational encounters with giant <a href="planet.html">planets</a> or passing stars.
                    During a star's formation, many more small bodies are scattered and ejected.

                    In 2017, the first such object (ʻOumuamua) was discovered inside the Solar System.
                    What made it stand out was its hyperbolic orbit, which could only mean entry from outside the system.
                    As of January 2026, only two other interstellar objects have been discovered.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Astronomers estimate that several interstellar objects pass inside <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>’s orbit each year, and about 10,000 are within <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>’s orbit at any given time.
                    These objects mostly approach from the direction of the <a href="constellation.html">constellation</a> Hercules, aligning with the Sun’s movement through the <a href="galaxy.html">galaxy</a> (called the solar apex).
                    Detection of many more such objects, however, remains a difficult task, as the only such objects that can be easily proven are the interlopers that approach Earth.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In rare cases, an interstellar object may be captured into a heliocentric orbit, usually by <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>’s gravity.
                    514107 Kaʻepaokaʻāwela and 96P/Machholz for example are suspected to be captured interstellar objects, though their origins are still debated.

                        1I/ʻOumuamua is the first interstellar object discovered in the Solar System.
                        In October 2017, the Pan-STARRS telescope detected a dim object moving in a hyperbolic orbit at a speed greater than the solar escape velocity.
                        No cometary activity was found and is thus comparable to an <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a>.

                        2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object, discovered in August 2029 by Gennnadiy Borisov, an amateur astronomer.
                        Further spectroscopic analysis has shown that its composition is similar to Oort Cloud <a href="comet.html">comets</a>.
                        In fact, 2I/Borisov had a coma and a dust tail.

                        3I/ATLAS is the third and latest interstellar object so far, discovered in July 2025.
                        Just like Borisov, 3I/ATLAS is a comet.
                        It has an eccentricity of 6.14 and a speed of 58 km/s, making it the most hyperbolic and fastest to date.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Interstellar objects have been proposed as possible targets of future missions mainly because of their foreign origin.
                    The greatest challenge is getting a spacecraft to one of them because of their high velocity.
                    One proposed mission could visit an interstellar object - the Comet Interceptor.
                    Developed by ESA and JAXA, it is planned to launch in 2029 and will be positioned at the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>-Earth L2 point.
                    It will wait up to three years for a suitable long-period comet to intercept.
                    If none are identified, the spacecraft could be tasked to intercept a reachable interstellar interloper at short notice.
