                        Hyperion is a <a href="natural-satellite.html">natural satellite</a> of <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>.
                        It is <a href="satellites-of-saturn.html">its largest irregularly-shaped moon</a> and was discovered by William and George Bond, and William Lassel in 1848.
                        It is named after a Greek mythological Titan.
                        Hyperion is remarkable for its sponge-like appearance, chaotic rotation, and deeply cratered surface.
                        Its low density suggests it is mostly empty space on the interior, as it is not massive enough to have collapsed into a round moon.

                    Hyperion was discovered in September 1848 by the American astronomer William Cranch Bond and his son George Phillips Bond, using the 15-inch refractor at the Harvard College Observatory.
                    Just two days later, independently, the British astronomer William Lassell also observed Hyperion.

                    Hyperion is named after one of the twelve Titans in Greek mythology, son of Gaia and Uranus, and the father of Helios, Selene, and Eos.
                    John Herschel, son of William Herschel, was the first to suggest naming satellites of Saturn after Titans and Giants, since Cronus (Greek analogue of the Roman Saturn) is their leader.

                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="OrbitAndRotation">Orbit and rotation</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Hyperion orbits Saturn at an average distance of about 1,481,500 kilometers and it takes approximately 21.3 <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> days to complete one orbit.
                    It is located between <a href="titan.html">Titan</a> and <a href="iapetus.html">Iapetus</a>, the outernmost regular satellite.
                    The orbits have an inclination on 0.6° and an eccentricity of 0.1.
                    Hyperion is in a 4:3 orbital resonance with Saturn’s largest moon, Titan.
                    This resonance leads to gravitational interactions that influence Hyperion’s chaotic rotation.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Unlike most moons, which are tidally locked to their parent planet, Hyperion tumbles chaotically due to its irregular shape and the gravitational influence of Saturn and Titan.
                    Its rotation is roughly 13 days, but is so unpredictable that scientists can barely determine its orientation from one orbit to the next.
                    Its Lyapunov time, or the time on which a dynamical system is chaotic, is around 30 days
                    Because of its chaotic spin, Hyperion does not have a fixed axis of rotation and no poles, making it one of a few known moons with such behavior, others being Nix and Hydra, <a href="satellites-of-pluto.html">moons</a> of <a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a>.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Hyperion is roughly 270 km in diameter, with triaxial mesurements of 360 × 266 × 205 km.
                    It is the largest irregularly-shaped and the eight largest moon of Saturn, as well as the third largest irregularly-shaped moon in the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a> (excluding unvisited moons of <a href="tno.html">trans-Neptunian objects</a>) after <a href="proteus.html">Proteus</a> and Nereid, which orbit <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>.
                    Hyperion is also the ninth most massive moon of Saturn, behind Phoebe.
                    Instead of being spherical, it has a rather elongated, potato-shaped body with one side carved in.
                    A theory suggests that Hyperion used to be much larger and is now a remnant of a violent impact.

                        Hyperion’s density is only about 0.54 times that of water.
                        This concludes that it is composed mostly of water ice with a significant amount of empty space inside, with no differentiation occuring.
                        Analysis based on Cassini data shows up to 40% porosity.

                        Hyperion’s surface is mostly water ice, with traces of dark, organic material and possibly frozen carbon dioxide.
                        The dark material is similar to that on Iapetus, possibly originating from <a href="phoebe.html">Phoebe</a>, and is concentrated at the bottom of its craters.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Hyperion’s surface is covered in deep, cup-like craters, many of which have sharp, well-defined rims.
                        The moon’s craters and high porosity give it a unique, spongy appearance.
                        Craters tend to compress the surface and not excavate material.
                        The porosity also allows craters to remain nearly unchanged over long periods of time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        One notable feature is the Bond-Lassel Dorsum, which appears to be a remnant rim of an impact crater 121.57 km in diameter and 10.2 km deep.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Hyperion has been visited by several spacecraft.
                    The first to transmit images was Voyager 2, but it only revealed its irregular shape and some craters and dark spots, without much else.
                    The Cassini orbiter performed several distant flybys of Hyperion, with the closest approach on September 26, 2005, at a distance of just 500 kilometers.
                    This flyby revealed the moon’s sponge-like surface in detail.
