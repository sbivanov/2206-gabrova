                    They are named after the Greek gods of fear and terror respectively. 
                    Phobos is the bigger of the two and orbits closer to Mars. 
                    Both are small irregularly-shaped bodies and it is believed that they originated from the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">asteroid belt</a>.
                    Both satellites' orbits are near the equator.
                    Of the two, Phobos is the one orbiting closer to Mars.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 1877, astronomer Asaph Hall was searching for moons on Mars.
                    He was inspired by previous speculations that there were two satellites orbiting Mars.
                    He was on the verge of giving up when in August he discovered Deimos.
                    Six days later, he found the second moon - Phobos.

                    Phobos and Deimos are named after the Greek sons of Ares, and personifications of fear and terror respectively. 
                    The names were suggested by the british chemist Henry Madan.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Phobos and Deimos are both tidally locked to Mars and are always facing the same side.
                    They orbit Mars much closer than the <a href="moon.html">Moon</a> does around <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.
                    This makes their apparent sizes from Mars's surface are around a third of that of the Moon from Earth.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Their origin is still contested.
                    One theory suggests that they were brought to a Mars orbit from the asteroid belt.
                    They share the same properties as C (carbonaceous) and D-type (dark) <a href="asteroid.html">asteroids</a> in terms of albedo and spectra.
                    However, they both have relatively regular orbits that must have been stabilized by Mars.
                    Another theory is that they formed from the collision that shaped the Northern Polar Basin on Mars, similar to the Moon's origin.
                    Several possibilities exist, like coalescing from a Martian ring, or being a surviving piece of that event.

                        Phobos is the bigger of the two moons.
                        It orbits closer to Mars with a higher eccentricity and inclination than Deimos.
                        One notable feature is the Stickney crater, which is half the width of Phobos.
                        Several "grooves" also appear radiating from one end of Phobos.
                        It has been the subject of three failed mission by the Soviet Union and later Russia.

                        Deimos is the second largest moon of Mars.
                        It is the smaller and the more distant from Mars of the two.
                        The surface has less unique features than Phobos and is marked by a few impact craters.
                        Its smoother appearance is cause by partial filling of some of its craters

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Both satellites were explored by most of the missions to Mars, where they were secondary targets.
                    Other missions that made flybys of Mars for acceleration (or deacceleration) also made close approaches to them, but they did not study them.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    There were several attempts at dedicated missions, but so far none were successful.
                    The last Soviet missions to the Martian system were the unsuccessful Phobos 1 and 2 missions.
                    They failed after a successful launch.
                    Phobos 2 managed to reach a Phobos orbit and send back photographs, before it lost communications and failed to deploy a lander and a rover.
                    After the fall of the Soviet Union, Rosaviacosmos, later Roskosmos, launched the mission Phobos-Grunt in collaboration with China's CNSA, who contributed with the Yinghuo 1 rover.
                    It was planned to be a sample return mission, but the mission was unsuccessful yet again.
                    Several rocket burns left the probe in low-Earth orbit and it fell back afterwards.
                    JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration is a planned Phobos and Deimos sample return mission, expected to launch in 2026.
