                        After it's discovery in 1930, Pluto was considered to be a <a href="planet.html">planet</a> until 2006, when the IAU recategorized it as a dwarf planet.

                        Seasons on Pluto are very dynamic, as the nitrogen ice can sublime during warmer periods and increase the atmospheric pressure dramatically, allowing for nitrogen to exist in liquid form.

                        Charon is so big compared to Pluto, that the barycenter of Pluto lies outside of it and both objects are tidally locked to each other.

                    In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier predicted the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune by using Newtonian mechanics after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a>.
                    New speculations about a ninth planet emerged after concluding that Neptune isn't the only object that disturbed the Uranus orbit.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Percival Lowell, an American businessman, founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, to search for the "Planet X".
                    He managed to capture two photos that would have proven its existence, but he never recognized them until his deatn in 1916.
                    In February 1930, after a legal battle over the observatory, Clyde Tombaugh, who was tasked the previous year with continuing the search, was looking for the hypothesized ninth planet, when on February 18th he compared photographs that revealed an object moving.
                    Later, the new object was confirmed to be a new "planet".

                <p class="paragraph">
                    After the discovery of other bodies beyond Neptune the number of planets, if they were recognised as such, could have been as high as a few hundred.
                    <a href="eris.html">Eris</a> in particular, discovered in 2005, was the main reason for the new category of objects.
                    It is the largest known dwarf planet by mass and at the time of discovery was also thought to be larger in size than Pluto.
                    For that reason, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.
                    The definition states that a dwarf planet orbits the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a> and is large enough to be round due to its own gravity, but has not cleared its orbit of other objects.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    This decision received considerable backlash, mostly on the basis of knowing Pluto as a planet for decades.
                    Big part of the astronomical community also met the decision with criticism.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pluto was named after the Roman god of the underworld, a suggestion made by an 11-year-old schoolgirl from Oxford, England.
                    The name was officially chosen among a thousand suggestions and was officially adopted on May 1, 1930.
                    The name stuck in part because the first two letters, PL, are the initials of Percival Lowell, who initiated the search for Pluto.

                        Pluto's orbit is highly elliptical (eccentricity of 0.249) and inclined (17°) compared to the planets, ranging from 30 to 49 AU from the Sun.
                        A small section of its orbit lies closer to the Sun than Neptune's, but they do not intersect.
                        It takes 247.94 <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> years for Pluto to complete one revolution around the Sun.
                        It will complete its first orbit since its discovery in 2178.
                        It is resonant with Neptune at a 2:3 resonance, one of many Kuiper belt objects called plutinos.

                        It takes 6.39 Earth days for Pluto to rotate around its axis.
                        It has an axial tilt of 120 degrees, resulting in a retrogage rotation and extreme seasonal variations.
                        This axis of rotation also lies outside Pluto because of the gravitaional pull of Charon, the biggest moon.

                    It's mass is 1.31 × 10^22 kilograms, or just 0.2% of Earth’s mass.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pluto is believed to have a differentiated internal structure.
                    At its core, scientists suggest there is a dense, rocky center, surrounded by an icy mantle.
                    The contents of this mantle are mostly water and other volatile ices such as methane and nitrogen.
                    Some models propose that beneath the icy mantle, there could be a subsurface ocean of liquid water, kept from freezing by the decay of radioactive elements.
                    This ocean, if it exists, would be buried deep beneath the surface and could be up to 100-180 kilometers thick.
                    The presence of such an ocean is supported by observations of cryovolcanism and the geologically young age of some surface features (like Sputnik Planitia), which suggest internal heat and geological activity.

                    The surface is remarkably diverse and complex, with a variety of terrains shaped by different geological processes.
                    So far only the northern hemisphere and areas up to 20° south of the Equator have been observed, the rest remaining in complete darkness for around a hundred years from the New Horizons visit.

                        There are two major regions that are opposite extremes in albedo.
                        The lighter one, Tombaugh Regio, is a heart-shaped icy region located mostly to the north of the Equator.
                        The most prominent feature there is Sputnik Planitia, a vast glacier made primarily of nitrogen ice, carbon monoxide, and methane.
                        This region is geologically young and lacks craters, suggesting ongoing surface renewal.
                        It has been suggested that Sputnik Planitia has formed after a collision with another Kuiper belt object.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The darker region is Belton Regio and is the biggest reddish-brown macula.
                        The color is due to tholins formed from the cosmic radiation of methane and nitrogen.
                        Along the Equator, apart from Belton Regio, other smaller maculae make up the so-called "Brass knuckles".
                        The maculae are more heavily cratered than Tombaugh Regio and are not as geologically active.

                        Pluto also boasts mountain ranges, such as the Norgay, Hillary, and al-Idrisi Montes, which rise up to 6.2 kilometers high.
                        There are also signs of cryovolcanism, with large domes and possible ice volcanoes indicating past or even present geological activity.
                        Wright and Picard Mons are suspected to be cryovolcanoes.

                    <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="Atmosphere">Atmosphere</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Pluto possesses a tenuous atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.
                        The atmospheric pressure is extremely low - about 100,000 times less than Earth’s.
                        Pluto’s atmosphere is highly dynamic, expanding when the Sun illuminates the surface and then freezing when in shadow.
                        The extreme axial tilt is responsible for the regions that can experience complete darkness for half a Plutonian year to be more than half of the total surface area.
                        For that reason, seasons on Pluto are extreme and it is theorized that the thickening of the atmosphere increases atmospheric pressure dramatically and liquid nitrogen appears to form rivers and streams. 
                        Cosmic and UV radiation also creates tholins from the nitrogen and methane in the atmosphere, which get deposited around the Equator.
                        Surface temperatures average around -229°C, or 44 K.

                        Pluto is orbited by five known natural satellites - Charon, Hydra, Nix, Kerberos and Styx. 
                        Names originate from Greek mythology and are related to the underworld. 
                        they are believed to have formed from the debris of a massive collision between Pluto and another Kuiper Belt object billions of years ago, similar to how Earth’s <a href="moon.html">Moon</a> is thought to have formed. 
                        All moons are moving in nearly circular paths around Pluto, close to the dwarf planet’s equatorial plane.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Charon is the biggest of the five satellites and is the only round one, with a diameter of about 1,212 kilometers - just over half that of Pluto itself.
                        It is named after the ferryman of the underworld.
                        It is so big compared to Pluto, that the barycenter lies outside of it and both objects are tidally locked to each other.
                        For that reason some refer to Pluto and Charon as a binary system.
                        Charon’s surface is a mix of water ice and darker material, with a prominent reddish tholin-covered cap at its north pole (Mordor Macula).
                        The most striking feature is a system of chasms and cliffs that stretch for hundreds of kilometers similar to <a href="miranda.html">Miranda</a>, a moon of Uranus.
                        Unlike Pluto, Charon lacks a substantial atmosphere, though there is evidence of a very thin one.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The four smaller moons - Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra — are much less massive and irregularly shaped, ranging from about 10 to 50 kilometers in their longest dimensions.
                        They orbit Pluto at greater distances than Charon and are thought to have a composition similar to that of Charon.
                        Nix and Hydra, the two bigger ones, were both discovered in 2005.
                        Kerberos and Styx were discovered in 2011 and 2012 respectively when New Horizons visited Pluto.
