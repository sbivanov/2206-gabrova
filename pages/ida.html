                        243 Ida is an <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> in the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">asteroid belt</a>, part of the Koronis family.
                        It has one known <a href="natural-satellite.html">moon</a> named Dactyl.
                        Ida is the second asteroid visited by the Galileo orbiter before its main mission around <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>, the other being <a href="gaspra.html">Gaspra</a>.
                        The two are also the first asteroids to be visited by a spacecraft.

                    Ida was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa in 1884 at the Vienna Observatory.
                    It was Palisa's 45th asteroid discovery.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    According to Greek mythology, Ida was a Creatan nymph who raised the god Zeus.
                    The name was given by Moriz von Kuffner, an Austrian industrialist and amateur astronomer.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Ida is located in the outer main belt, with a semi-major axis of 2.861 AU, an eccentricity of 0.046, and an inclination of 1.138°.
                    It takes Ida 4.83 years to complete one trip around the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a> and 4.63 hours to rotate around its axis.
                    Ida is part of the Koronis collisional family, which has almost 6000 known members, with the largest member being 208 Lacrimosa.

                    Ida has triaxial dimensions of 59.8 × 25.4 × 18.6 km and a mean diameter of 31,4 km.
                    Its shape is elongated and is made of two geologically distinct halves joined in the middle.

                    Like other members of the Koronis family, Ida is a stony (S-class) asteroid, consisting mostly of silicate rocks.
                    Olivine and pyroxene have been detected on the surface.
                    Parts of the asteroid resemble ordinary chondrite meteorites in composition, which asre the most common type found on <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Space weathering has been observed on the surface of Ida.
                    This phenomenon darkens the surface of Ida and makes it reddish in appearance.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The surface of Ida is saturated by craters to the extend that new impacts erase older ones.
                    The largest of them are almost as wide as the diameter of Ida and have carved out the surface significantly.
                    Among the largest craters are Lascaux, Orgnac, and Mammoth.
                    Young impacts like Azzurra don't display ejecta blankets like on planetary-mass objects because of its rapid rotation.
                    The same would apply to other asteroids with a similar rotational period.
                    Several depressions of low crater count are located at opposite ends of Ida - Vienna and Pola Regio.
                    Townsend Dorsum crosses the asteroid along the half near Pola Regio.

                        Ida has one moon Dactyl.
                        It was discovered during the Galileo flyby and is named after the mythological dactyls that lived on Mount Ida in Crete.
                        It is only 1,4 km in diameter, roughly spherical and is possibly a result from an impact on Ida, or captureb dy it during the collision event that formed the Koronis family.
                        The orbit is not precisely known, but during the discovery Dactyl was 90 km from Ida.
                        Two craters on Dactyl are named - Acmon and Celmis.

                        The Galileo mission to Jupiter is the first to make flybys of asteroids.
                        After Gaspra and another Earth gravity assist, Ida became the second asteroid visited in August 1993.
