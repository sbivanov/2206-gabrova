                        Uranus, similar to the other ice giant <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>, consists of volatiles (ices), whereas the gas giants are mostly made up of hydrogen and helium. 
                        Uranus has a ring system like other giants. 
                        Its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. 
                        29 <a href="natural-satellite.html">moons</a> are known to exist, all named after characters from plays by Shakespeare and "The Rape of the Lock" by Alexander Pope.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In English and many other languages, Uranus is the only planet named after a Greek god instead of a Roman god.
                    It is named after Uranus, the personification of the sky.
                    The name was originally proposed by Johann Bode, who suggested that the planet is named similarly to the other planets.
                    Names that were suggested earlier were "Georgium Sidum" and "Herschel".
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, its name is literally translated as the "sky king star" (天王星), refering to Uranus being a sky god.
                    In Hindi the planet is named after the charioteer god Aruna (अरुण).

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Uranus was observed before it was proven to be a planet.
                    The earliest definite record is in 1690, when the english astronomer John Flamsteed catalogued it as 34 Tauri.
                    In 1781 sir William Herschel looked through a telescope, discovering the object.
                    He originally mistook it for a <a href="comet.html">Miranda</a>comet</a>, but based on his findings, other astronomers identified it as a planet.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        It takes Uranus 17 days to complete a rotation around it's axis.
                        Some features move faster and complete a rotation for even less.
                        The planet has an extreme axial tilt of 82.23° and rotates retrograde, similarly to <a href="venus.html">Venus</a>.
                        The reason is unknown, but it is suggested that a protoplanet collided with Uranus, causing it's almost parallel to the ecliptic.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Uranus is 20 AU away from the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a> on average, with a perihelion of 18.3 AU and an aphelion of 20.1 AU from the Sun.
                        The eccentricity is 0.047.
                        Early observations of Uranus lead to the discovery of a planet that influenced the Uranian orbit - <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>.

                    Uranus has a radius of 25,362 km, four times that of <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.
                    Uranus is slightly larger than Neptune, but less massive.

                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="InternalStructure">Internal structure</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The standard model of the Uranian structure is that it consists of three layers: a silicate/metallic core, an icy (water, ammonia and methane) mantle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium atmosphere.
                    The core is only half the size of Earth and comprises supercritical liquid iron, nickel and silicates.
                    The surrounding mantle is made of supercritical volatiles.
                    These volatiles, also called ices, are what makes Uranus an ice giant.
                    Due to the high pressure and temperatures in the mantle, it is suggested that diamond rains appear.
                    This process also appears on other giant planets.

                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="AtmosphereAndClimate">Atmosphere and climate</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Uranus has an atmosphere composed of mostly hydrogen and helium.
                    There are trace amounts of other elements, like methane, which gives Uranus it's pale blue color.
                    The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into the troposphere, the stratosphere and a hot thermosphere.
                    Within the troposphere, methane clouds form at 1.2 bar; ammonia and hydrogen sulfide clouds between 3 and 10 bars, ammonium hydrosulfide clouds at 20-40 bars and water clouds at 50 bars and lower.
                    Not much is known about the atmosphere and several proposals for a Uranus atmospheric probe were made.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The atmosphere has little features - during its flyby, Voyager 2 saw only a few discrete clouds and some dark spots.
                    More recent observations reveal that Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds when approaching equinox.

                        Uranus, like other giants, has a low-albedo ring system.
                        They are separated into three groups.
                        The main rings are nine - 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, and ε.
                        They are narrow and composed of tiny particle and dust.
                        Two other rings - ζ and λ are known as dusty rings.
                        ζ is the innermost of all the rings and λ is located between δ and ε.
                        There are two outer rings: the inner ν is reddish and the outer μ is blue.

                        All of the moons are named after characters from plays by Shakespeare and "The Rape of the Lock" by Alexander Pope. 
                        The biggest one is <a href="titania.html">Titania</a>, followed by <a href="oberon.html">Oberon</a>, <a href="umbriel.html">Umbriel</a>, <a href="ariel.html">Ariel</a>, and the smallest - <a href="miranda.html">Miranda</a>.
                        All of the moons are relatively dark, with Umbriel being the darkest.
                        They are made of rock and ice and feature craters, canyons and scarps.
                        Miranda is unique, as it features extremely large scarps on it's surface like the 20km high Verona Rupes.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The other 24 moons are divided into inner and irregular.
                        The inner moons orbit within Miranda's orbit, the closest to Uranus of the five round moons.
                        The biggest of them is Puck.
                        All of the  irregular moons orbit outside Oberon's orbit, the farthest round moon from Uranus.
                        They orbit in retrograde, with the exception of Margaret.
                        Sycorax is the largest moon of this group.

                    Voyager 2 was the only spacecraft to visit Uranus in 1986.
                    During its flyby, it studied the atmosphere, weather and magnetosphere of Uranus, the five biggest moons and discovered ten smaller ones.
                    A number of missions to Uranus have been proposed.
                    Such propositions include several missions by ESA (MUSE, ODINUS and Uranus Pathfinder), NASA (Oceanus and NASA Uranus orbiter and probe) and CNSA (Tianwen-4)
