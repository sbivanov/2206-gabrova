                        The Sun is the <a href="star.html">star</a> of the Solar System.
                        It is a G-type yellow dwarf and has 8 known <a href="planet.html">planets</a> orbiting around it.
                        The Sun is 4.5 billion years old and is expected to last 5 billion more years as a main sequence star, before it becomes a red giant.

                    At the center of the solar nebula that formed the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a> 4,6 billion years ago, gravity pulled more and more material together into a protostar that would become the Sun.
                    With time, the protostar Sun achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and began thermonuclear fusion, becoming a main-sequence star.

                    In 5 billion years, the Sun will enter its red giant phase after turning all of its hydrogen into helium.
                    It will destroy Mercury, venus, and possibly Earth, and the habitable zone will move all the way to the orbit of Jupiter.
                    Eventually it will use up all of the helium and won't be able to commense the fusion of heavier elements and will send its outer layer into space forming a planetary nebula and leaving a dense white dwarf.
