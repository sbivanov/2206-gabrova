                        It is also the only natural astronomic body other than Earth that has been visited by people. 
                        It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and is the largest relative to it's parent planet.

                        The Moon has no magnetic field, a hydrosphere, or a significant athmosphere.
                        Instead, it is heavily cratered and contains multiple valleys known as "maria" formed by cooling of the Moon during formation.
                        The Moon was likely formed when a protoplanet (called Theia) collided with Earth 4.5 billion years ago.

                        The Moon has been visited by multiple spacecraft.
                        The first object to do so was Luna 2.
                        During the Apollo program, 12 men landed on the moon.
                        Currently the Artemis program is going to land people almost fifty years after the last Apollo mission.

                    The leading theory of the formation of the Moon is that a protoplanet around the size of Mars collided with Earth.
                    The debris were ejected outside Earth and compressed into a molten magma-covered Moon.
                    With time, the magma cooled down, forming the crust.
                    The Lunar maria were produced by this process.
                    The remaining features are impact craters from meteorites.

                    The Moon is 384,400 km away from <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> on average with a perigee of 362,600 km and an apogee of 405,400 km.
                    The eccentricity of the Moon's orbit is 0.05.
                    The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth and rotates around Earth and around its axis with the same rate.
                    This makes one side of the Moon visible - the near side, while the far side (also misleadingly called "dark side") is invisible from Earth.
                    A synodic orbital period of the moon is 29.53 Earth days.
                    This period is approximately 1/12 of a year on Earth and is used as a reference in Lunar calendars.
                    A sidereal orbital period is 27.32 days.

                        During the synodic orbital period, the moon completes a cycle of phases.
                        Those phases are determined by the position of the Moon relative to the Sun and Earth.
                        When the moon is between the Sun and Earth, a new moon appears.
                        It is invisible to the naked eye, except during solar eclipses.
                        New moon is followed by a waxing crescent, growing up to a half illuminated near side - first quarter.
                        First quarter is then followed by a waxing gibbous (between half and fully illuminated near side) and a full moon, which is seen as fully illuminated.
                        A full moon is followed by a waning gibbous, a third quarter and a waning crescent before it completes the cycle with a new moon.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        There are two types of eclipses seen from Earth - a solar and a lunar.
                        During a solar eclipse, the moon is in its new moon phase and is covering the Sun.
                        When the moon is completely covering the Sun, it is called a total solar eclipse.
                        From Earth the Moon appears as big as the Sun, so it can almost perfectly hide it in a total solar eclipse.
                        A lunar eclipse occurs when a full moon is in the shadow of Earth and gets little to no sunlight.
                        There are three types of lunar eclipses.
                        A penumbral eclipse occurs when the Moon is in Earth's penumbra (the shadow partially obstructed from sunlight).
                        A partial lunar eclipse is seen when a part of the Moon is in Earth's umbra (shadow fully obstructing the sunlight)
                        A total lunar eclipse has the Moon within Earth's umbra in it's entirety.
                        The Moon appears red during the total eclipse similarly to a rising and setting sun.

                        The Moon is 3.7 times smaller than Earth, with a mean radius of 1,737.4 km.
                        It has a similar structure to Earth.
                        The core is divided into a solid inner and a liquid outer core, composed of iron and some nickel.
                        The mantle is made of iron-rich silicates like olivine and pyroxene and the crust has lighter minerals.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The near side of the Moon features most of the Lunar maria - valleys, formed by lava cooling.
                        They have a darker color than the rest of the surface.
                        Some of these maria are Mare Imbrium, Oceanus Procellarum, Mare Crisium, Mare Frigoris, Mare Cognitum, Mare Tranquillitatis, Mare Fecunditatis and more.
                        The rest of the surface is lighter and covered with craters.
                        The largest impact basin is the South Pole-Aitken basin, which is one of the biggest known impact craters.
                        Most of the Lunar maria basins are located in a impact basin, the biggest of which is Imbrium (Procellarum is not confirmed to be an impact basin.)
                        Other craters include Tycho, Schrödinger basin, Van De Graaf, etc.

                        The moon has a very thin exosphere and contains ice water.
                        During the Chandrayaan-1 mission the first evidences of water on the Moon were found.
                        Subsequent missions further proved those discoveries.
                        Water ice on the Moon is concentrated around the poles within deep shadowy impact craters.

                    The Moon is known since ancient times.
                    It's regular phases were used for the making of many calendars.
                    The Moon was categorised as a planet until Galileo Galilei's discovery of the four natural <a href="natural-satellite.html">satellites</a> of <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>.
                    He still was unsure what to call them, as they were the first object other than the Moon to orbit planets instead of the Sun.
                    It took several years for the word satellite to be used.
                    Natural satellites are also called moons after the Moon.
                    Galileo made observations of the Moon with his telescope and discovered landforms on its surface.
                    Multiple people produced maps of the Moon, displaying its "maria" and craters.

                        After the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet Union began the development of rockets, known as launch systems, to launch objects outside the <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.
                        The launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, marked the beginning of the Space Race between the USa and the USSR.
                        One of the objectives of the race was to send people to the Moon, as it is the closest celestial object to the Earth.
                        The Soviet Union began it's Luna program.
                        Luna 1 was the first spacecraft to reach the Moon and Luna 2 was the fist to impact the surface.
                        Luna 3 was the first to fly by the far side, making the first photographs of it.
                        Luna 9 made the first soft landing and Luna 10 followed with the first orbit around the Moon.
                        After the USA's successful Apollo 11 crewed mission to the Moon, the Luna program continued - Luna 16 made a sample return and Luna 17 brought the first rover - Lunokhod 1.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Soviet Union also had other Lunar programs apart from Luna.
                        The Zond program was an attempt at conducting crewed flights to the moon.
                        Zond 5 sent the first lifeforms to the Moon (without landing) and returned safely to the Earth - two tortoises and other animals and plants intended for feeding the tortoises.
                        The Soviet Union also had plans for sending people, but never did.

                        Many uncrewed missions were conducted under the Pioneer program, but none successful with the exception of a partial success of Pioneer 4.
                        Following the Pioneer program was the Ranger program, with Ranger 4 being the first American mission to impact the Moon.

                        During the development of the uncrewed missions, a program aimed at sending the first people to the Moon started.
                        The Apollo Mission was president John Kennedy's suggestion for a crewed mission to the surface of the Moon by the end of the 60s.
                        In 1967, Apollo 1 caught fire before launching, resulting in the death of all three crew members.
                        After the tragedy, several uncrewed tests were conducted before returning to crewed flights.
                        Apollo 7 was a successful validation of the rocket systems.
                        Apollo 8 was the first to send people to the Moon, orbiting around the Moon ten times.
                        Apollo 9 tested rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit, while Apollo 10 made an uncrewed landing of the Lunar module on the Moon.

                        In 1969, Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin and Michael Collins were travelling to the Moon on the Apollo 11 mission.
                        While in Lunar orbit, Armstrong and Aldrin moved into the Lunar lander "Eagle", while Collins stayed in the command module "Columbia".
                        Finally, on 20 July 1969 Eagle landed on the surface on the Moon in Mare Tranquillitatis.
                        Six and a half hours later Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the Moon and were the first to do so.
                        While doing so Armstrong said the famous words: "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."
                        The tasks they were doing were walking on the surface, taking photographs, collecting samples, deploying scientific instruments and continuously broadcasting back to Earth.
                        The three astronauts returned safely on July 24.

                        Apollo 12 was the second crewed landing mission, landing near the Surveyor 3 lander.
                        Apollo 13 was meant to be the third landing mission, but due to a failure in an oxygen tank, the crew members returned without landing.
                        The Apollo 13 mission was reassigned to Apollo 14, which succeeded.
                        Three more Apollo missions sent people on the surface.
                        These missions were extended and the first time a crewed rover was used.
                        No people have been to the Moon since then.

                        NASA sent multiple spacecrafts, including Artemis 1, part of the Artemis program and follow-up to the Apollo Mission.
                        Artemis 1 was an uncrewed mission to the Moon and is going to be followed by Artemis 2, a crewed Moon-orbiting mission and Artemis 3 and 4, crewed Moon-landing missions.
                        Multiple CubeSats were deployed during Artemis 1, some of which still in operations.

                        Three more orbiter mission were launched before the Chang'e 4 mission.
                        It was the first to land on the far side of the Moon and included the Yutu-2 rover.
                        Chang'e 5 was China's first sample return from the Moon.
                        Upcoming Chinese missions to the Moon are Change 6, 7 and 8, the last of which will 3D print with Lunar resources, and a Crewed Lunar Mission by 2030.

                    The Moon is the brightest object in the night sky and played a crucial role in the culture of ancient civilisations.
                    Calendars were based on the monthly cycle of the Moon.
                    Each month begins and ends with a new moon.
                    In many languages, the word for month comes from the name of the Moon.

                    The symbol most associated with the Moon is a crescent.
                    In many logographic writing systems a crescent, or a derivative of a crescent is used.
                    For example, the Egyptian hieroglyph 𓇹 is a crescent, while the Chinese symbol 月 developed from a crescent.
                    A star and crescent is an old symbol, depicting the Moon and Venus.
                    It was used in the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman Empire and is also a symbol of Islam.
                    The Lunar maria also appeared as different images.
                    In Western cultures, it has been interpreted as a man, while in Chinese and Mesoamerican cultures, it is interpreted as a rabbit.

                    Since the Scientific Revolution, the modern perception of the Moon changed.
                    The idea of spacefligh and people on the Moon became more popular.
                    Examples of media imagining travelling to the Moon include Jules Verne's novel "From the Earth to the Moon" and the 1902 movie "A Trip to the Moon".
