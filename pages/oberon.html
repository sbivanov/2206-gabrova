                        Oberon is the second largest <a href="natural-satellite.html">moon</a> of <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a> and the most distant <a href="satellites-of-uranus.html">among the five round ones</a>.
                        It was discovered by William Herschel and is named after a fairy from a play by Shakespeare.
                        It is a relatively dark, geologically inactive moon made of rock and ice and features numerous craters with vast ejecta blankets like Hamlet and Othello.
                        Oberon has been visited by only one mission - Voyager.

                    William Herschel discovered the two biggest moons of Uranus in 1787 - <a href="titania.html">Titania</a> and Oberon.

                    The one to give the first Uranian moons names was astronomer John Herschel, his son.
                    His naming theme was supposed to be that of magical spirits from English literature.
                    Oberon is named after the king of the fairies, who is a character from William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.

                    Oberon orbits Uranus from a distance of around 584,000 km, making it the most distant of the major moons.
                    Of these five, it is the only one outside the magnetosphere of Uranus, and thus does not feature a darker trailing hemisphere.
                    It takes 13.5 <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> days to complete its orbit around Uranus.
                    The orbit of Oberon is nearly circular (0.001 eccentriciy) and has an inclination of 0.06°.
                    Like all known round satellites, Oberon is tidally locked to Uranus.

                    Oberon is the second largest moon of Uranus at 1522.8 km.
                    Albeit smaller, it is more massive than <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>'s moon <a href="rhea.html">Rhea</a>.

                    Oberon has a density of roughly 1.63 g/cm³, indicating a composition of roughly half water ice and half rock.
                    It is likely differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle, with possible traces of ammonia and methane that would allow for a subsurface ocean.

                    Oberon is the second darkest of the Uranian moons after <a href="umbriel.html">Umbriel</a>.
                    Unlike the other four, darkening of the trailing hemispheres is not observed on Oberon.
                    The surface is reddish in color apart from the bright rays left by recent craters.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Oberon is the most heavily cratered of Uranus’s major moons, with large impact basins, some also featuring bright-rays.
                    The largest known craters are Hamlet and Macbeth, both slightly over 200 km in diameter
                    Craters like Hamlet, Macbeth, and Othello are surrounded by bright ejecta rays and have dark basins.
                    One possible larger crater might exist on the south pole, as images by Voyager 2 show what appears to be a central peak of an impact near the edge of Oberon.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Very few other features are seen on the images by Voyager 2.
                    One named canyon, Mommur Chasma, suggests an episode of past activity.
                    It is likely that there are more such faults on the north hemisphere.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Because of the extreme axial tilt of Uranus, Oberon experiences great seasonal changes.
                    During the Voyager 2 flyby, only the southern hemisphere was luminated by the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>, leaving the north undocumented.

                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Exploration">Exploration</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Voyager 2 was the only spacecraft to visit Oberon in 1986.
                    It made a flyby with the closest approach at 470,600 km, making images at a relatively low spatial resolution. 
                    A number of missions to Uranus have been proposed by ESA, NASA, and CNSA to revisit the Uranus system.
