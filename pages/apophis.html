                    99942 Apophis is a sub-kilometer <a href="nea.html">near-Earth asteroid</a>, part of the Aten group.
                    It was discovered in 2004 and drew attention for its possible impact with <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.
                    Since then, analysis has ruled out an impact, but its 2029 close approach will alter its orbit into an Apollo group member.
                    Apophis will be the target of the OSIRIS-APEX mission, a follow-up to its visit and sample collection of <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> <a href="bennu.html">Bennu</a>.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Apophis was discovered on 19 June 2004, by Roy A. Tucker, David J. Tholen, and Fabrizio Bernardi at the Kitt Peak National Observatory.

                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Name">Name</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Apophis is named after the Greek name of the Ancient Egyptian deity of the underworld Apep.
                    He is an enemy of the sun god Ra and is depicted as a snake.
                    The name, part Egyptian and part Greek, was selected in reference to its close approach, whien it will alter its orbit from an Aten (named after an Egyptian god) to an Apollo (named after a Greek god) group one.

                    Apophis is a near-Earth asteroid, part of the Aten group.
                    Its semi-major axis is 0.9224 AU and has a 	0.7461 AU perihelion and a 1.0987 AU aphelion.
                    Apophis completes one orbit every 0.886 years, or 324 days.
                    The eccentricity of its orbit is 0.1911 and the inclination is 3.341°.
                    The rotational period is around 30.4 hours, but its axis is not fixed, making Apophis a tumbler.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Apophis is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid.
                    The Earth minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) is 0.000038 AU, or 5.7 thousand km from Earth's center.

                <h3 class="paragraphheader" id="ImpactRisk">Impact risk</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Upon discovery, it was estimated that there is a 1 in 233 chance of impact with Earth in 2029.
                    Later the same day, it was increased to 1 in 62.
                    In the following days, the rick increased up to 1 in 37 until a precovery greatly improved observation data and eliminated the risk.
                    Subsequent observations also eliminated both a 2036 and a 2068 impact.
                    During its peak estimated risk, Apophis scored a 4 on the Torino scale and 1.1 on the Palermo scale, the highest recorded so far.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    On 13 April 2029, Apophis will make a close approach 0.00025 AU from Earth, which will perturb its orbit.
                    After the flyby, Apophis will have the orbit of an Apollo asteroid, with a 1.103 AU semi-major axis, 0.895 AU perihelion and a 1.31 AU aphelion.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Apophis has dimensions of 450 × 170 m and a mean 370 diameter.
                    Apophis has a very elongated shape and appears to be a possible contact binary.

                    Apophis is an S-type asteroid, leaning towards a Q-type.
                    It is made up of silicate materials and possibly higher amount of olivine and pyroxene.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The surface of Apophis has yet to be documented by the OSIRIS-APEX mission.
                    If it is similar to other asteroids of this size, Apophis might be a rubble pile made up of many rock fragments, with many boulders appearing on the surface.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Apophis will be visited by the OSIRIS-APEX (<b>Ap</b>ophis <b>Ex</b>plorer mission by NASA.
                    The spacecraft previously went under the name OSIRIS-REx and visited another potentially hazardous and high risk asteroid, Bennu.
                    The extended mission will follow a similar timeline: it will reach Apophis round the time of its April 2029 close approach, enter orbit and gather data, then make an impact and study the exposed surface.
                    However, no samples will be returned.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Along the OSIRIS-APEX probe, ESA is also considering sending probes.
                    The two proposed missions, Ramses and Satis, have a three year launch window before the 2029 close approach.
                    Ramses will have a similar design to Hera, an ongoing mission to the <a href="didymos.html">Didymos</a> system, where the DART impactor succesfully altered the orbit of the <a href="natural-satellite.html">moon</a> Dimorphos.
