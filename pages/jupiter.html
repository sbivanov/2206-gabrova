                    It's original name in ancient Greece was Phaeton (Φαέθων, "shining one").

                    In Chinese, Japanese and neighboring countries the planet is refered to as "wood star" (木星).
                    In Vedic astrology, the planet is named after Brihaspati (बृहस्पति), the "guru of devas" or teacher of gods.

                        Jupiter orbits 5.2 AU away from the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>, 4.95 AU during perihelion and 5.46 AU during aphelion.
                        It takes 11.86 Earth years to complete an orbit.
                        The orbital plane of Jupiter is inclined 1.30° compared to the ecliptic and has an eccentricity of 0.049.

                        Jupiter's axial tilt is only 3.13°.
                        Jupiter rotates the fastest of all the planets, completing a rotation in ten hours on average.
                        This makes the planet more flattened than other planets at 6.8% flattening, with only <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a> having a higher percent.
                        Just like other giants, Jupiter observes a differential rotation.
                        The Jovian poles rotate slower, rotating 5 minutes longer than the equator.

                    Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System.
                    It has a diameter 11.2 times that of <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> and one tenth of the Sun.
                    <a href="exoplanet.html">Exoplanets</a> that are gas giants, are similar to Jupiter and are therefore called "Jupiters".

                    Jupiter is composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of ammonia, methane and water.
                    In the atmosphere, helium makes up 10% of the volume, but a quarter of the mass.
                    Deep inside the planet, the mantle is composed of metallic hydrogen, which contributes to the strong magnetosphere of Jupiter.
                    Data collected by the Juno spacecraft suggests that Jupiter has a large and partially dissolved core.

                        Jupiter has a very dynamic atmosphere full of storms, clouds and differently colored bands.
                        The clouds at the top layers are possibly crystalline ammonia, the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals and the innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor.
                        The colorful stripes on Jupiter are quickly spinning streams of clouds.
                        Different, but exactly unknown compounds give the storms the red, white and yellow colors.

                        Storms on Jupiter are long lasting vortices.
                        The most well-known is the Great Red Spot, a persistent anticyclonic storm located 22° south of the equator.
                        The storm has existed for at least 191 years.
                        Since it's discovery, the storm has shrunk in size.
                        Other storms include a series of "pearls" - massive counterclockwise rotating storms that appear as white ovals in the southern hemisphere.
                        Since 1986, the ovals have varied in number from six to nine.

                    They were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 and are called Galilean moons. 
                    Ganymede is the largest known satellite and is bigger than <a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a>.

                        The two spacecrafts made the first close-up images of Jupiter.
                        Voyager 1 and 2 discovered Jupiter's rings, observed the Galilean moons and found a few moons.
                        Ulysses, a solar probe, performed a flyby around Jupiter to attain a polar orbit around the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>.
                        The Cassini-Huygens passed Jupiter on it's way to the Saturn system.
                        The last to fly by Jupiter was New Horizons, a mission aimed at visiting <a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a>.

                        Galileo was the first Jupiter orbiter.
                        It studied the system and it's moons for seven years, until it's intentional destruction.
                        An atmospheric probe was released into Jupiter to determine the atmospheric composition.
                        It also witnessed the impact of the <a href="comet.html">comet</a> Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter.

                        Juno is the follow-up mission of Galileo.
                        It is the second New Frontiers mission after New Horizons.
                        It's target was gathering further information about Jupiter.
                        The mission is currently extended and will end in 2025, meeting the same fate as Galileo.

                        The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, a program developed by the ESA, launched in 2023.
                        It will perform several flybys around Jupiter and the moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.
                        The last objective is to enter orbit around the biggest moon Ganymede.
                        NASA launched the Europa Clipper the next year.
                        The objective is to study Europa, mainly because of it's potential life suspected to inhabit an internal ocean.
                        CNSA is preparing for launching Tianwen-4 in 2035 with the mission to study the Jovian magnetosphere and atmosphere, as well as Ganymede or Callisto.
