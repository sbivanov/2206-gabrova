                        Jupiter has a semi-major axis of 5.2 AU and is the fifthe planet from the Sun, with an orbit ranging from 4.95 AU at perihelion and 5.46 AU at aphelion.
                        It takes 11.86 Earth years to complete one orbit.
                        The orbital plane of Jupiter is inclined 1.30° relative to the ecliptic and has an eccentricity of 0.049.

                        Jupiter's axial tilt is low, at only 3.13°.
                        Jupiter exhibits the fastest rotation of any planet in the Solar System, completing a rotation in about 10 hours on average.
                        This rapid spin results in a significant equatorial flattening of 6.8%, second only to that of <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>.
                        Just like other giants, Jupiter displays a differential rotation.

                    A large group of <a href="asteroid.html">asteroids</a> co-orbits with Jupiter, known as trojans.
                    These asteroids are divided into two groups: the Greek camp, clustered around the leading Lagrange point (L4), and the Trojan camp, around the trailing Lagrange point (L5).
                    As of August 2025, there are 15,283 trojan asteroids according to the Minor Planet Center.
                    The Greek camp contains 9,691 known trojans, with the largest being <a href="hektor.html">624 Hektor</a>, 911 Agamemnon, and 588 Achilles.
                    The Trojan camp, meanwhile, includes 5,592 known asteroids, with the most prominent being the binary <a href="patroclus.html">617 Patroclus</a>-Menoetius, 3451 Mentor, and 3317 Paris.

                    They are also refered to as trojans after the Jovian ones.
                    However, these planets have considerably less trojans than Jupiter.

                        Beyond the trojans, Jupiter’s gravitational influence extends to other asteroid populations.
                        The Hilda asteroids, named after 153 Hilda, occupy orbits outside the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">main asteroid belt</a> but within Jupiter’s orbits.
                        Their aphelia align with either of Jupiter’s L3, L4, and L5 Lagrange points and are in a 3:2 orbital resonance with the planet.
                        Additionally, Jupiter’s gravity shapes the distribution and dynamics of the main asteroid belt, clearing certain orbital resonances, creating the so-called Kirkwood gaps, and shepherding asteroid families into stable zones.
                        There are still asteroid population within the gaps like the Alinda and Griqua groups.

                        Apart from influencing the orbits of asteroids, Jupiter also interacts with <a href="comet.html">comets</a>, most notably the Jupiter family. 
                        They are defined as short-period comets that have a semi-major axis smaller than Jupiter's.
                        Members of the Jupiter family are thought to have formed in the Kuiper belt outside the orbit of <a href="mercury.html">Neptune</a>.
                        During close encounters with Jupiter, they are perturbed into orbits with a smaller period. 
                        Occasionally, some comets are pertrubed into even more eccentric comets, and sometimes even hyperbolic ones.
                        Others get destroyed, like Shoemaker-Levy 9.

                    Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System.
                    It has a mean diameter of 139,822 kilometers, or 10.9 times that of Earth and roughly one-tenth the diameter of the Sun.
                    Jupiter’s mass is 2.5 times greater than the combined mass of all other planets in the Solar System, exerting a gravitational influence that shapes the orbits of asteroids and comets.

                    Jupiter’s composition is dominated by hydrogen and helium, mirroring the primordial mix of the early Solar System.
                    Trace amounts of ammonia, methane, and water are also present.
                    In its outer layers, helium constitutes about 10% of the volume but contributes roughly a quarter of the planet’s total mass.
                    Beneath the gaseous outer layers, increasing pressure and temperature transform hydrogen into a metallic state, forming a thick mantle of metallic hydrogen.
                    This electrically conductive layer is responsible for Jupiter’s powerful magnetosphere, the strongest of any planet in the Solar System.
                    Data from NASA’s Juno mission has revealed that Jupiter’s core is large and partially dissolved, with heavy elements possibly mixed into the surrounding metallic hydrogen.
                    This finding challenges earlier models that assumed a small and compact core, or even no core at all.

                        Jupiter has a turbulent and ever-changing atmosphere full of storms, clouds and differently colored bands.
                        The clouds at the top layers are likely composed of crystalline ammonia, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals, and the innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor.
                        The colorful stripes of alterating light zones and dark belts on Jupiter are quickly spinning streams of clouds.
                        The exact chemical compounds responsible for the red, white, and yellow hues of these bands and storms remain uncertain, though candidates include phosphorus, sulfur, and complex hydrocarbons.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Storms on Jupiter are massive, long-lived vortices.
                        The most famous is the Great Red Spot, a persistent anticyclonic storm located 22° south of the equator.
                        Observed continuously since at least 1831, this storm has persisted for over 190 years, though it has gradually shrunk in size over time.
                        Other notable features include a series of "pearls” - massive, counterclockwise-rotating white ovals in the southern hemisphere.
                        Since 1986, the ovals have varied in number from six to nine.

                        Jupiter boasts the most powerful and extensive magnetosphere of any planet in the Solar System with a dipole moment of 4.170 gauss.
                        It is generated by the motion of metallic hydrogen deep within its interior.
                        This magnetic field extends millions of kilometers into space, creating a vast region of charged particles that interacts with the solar wind and traps radiation in intense belts.
                        The magnetosphere is so large that, if visible to the naked eye, it would appear several times the size of the Moon from Earth.
                        It accelerates particles to near-light speeds, producing auroras at the planet’s poles and influencing the environments of its moons.
                        Most notably, Io's volcanic activity feeds a torus of sulfur dioxide along its orbit.
                        The gas is ionized in Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing sulfur and oxygen ions, which, together with hydrogen ions, form a plasma sheet.
                        The plasma causes deformation of the dipole magnetic field into that of a magnetodisk.

                        These rings appear to be made of mostly dust particles, likely from micrometeoroid impacts on its moons, similar to the rings of Neptune.

                        Io is a satellite of Jupiter that is slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
                        It is volcanically active and has hundreds of volcanoes.
                        The activity of Io is caused by the gravitational pull of Jupiter on one side and Ganymede and Europa on the other side.
                        Together these three satellites are in a orbital resonance with each other.
                        Volcano eruptions can be so powerful that Earth telescopes can see them.

                        Europa is the smallest Galilean moon and is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon.
                        It is an icy moon with a smooth surface full of dark streaks.
                        It is speculated that Europa could have a subsurface ocean where extraterrestrial life could exist.
                        This is similar to Ganymede and Callisto, but there are more evidences showing such ocean on Europa than on the other two moons.
                        A similar satellite is <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>'s moon <a href="enceladus.html">Enceladus</a>.
                        The orbiter Europa Clipper by NASA that was launched in 2024 is planned to study the Europan surface.

                    There are four satellites that orbit closer to Jupiter than Io - Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe.
                    They have regular orbits, that are prograde and have a low eccentricity and inclination, just like the Galilean moons.
                    Metis and Adrastea maintain Jupiter's main ring, whereas Amalthea and Thebe maintain their own faint outer rings.

                    Jupiter has been known since ancient times, visible to the naked eye as the second-brightest planet in the night sky after <a href="venus.html">Venus</a>.
                    In 1610, Galileo Galilei made the first detailed observations of Jupiter, discovering its four largest moons, now known as the Galilean moons.
                    These moons were later named Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto by the astronomer Simon Marius, who also discovered them independently.
                    In 1665, Giovanni Cassini became the first to document the planet’s atmospheric bands and storms.
                    Centuries later, in 1892, American astronomer E.E. Barnard discovered Amalthea, Jupiter’s fifth moon.
                    By the time of the Voyager 1 mission, eight more moons had been identified through ground-based observations.

                        Several spacecraft have visited Jupiter, including two orbiters.
                        Early missions, such as Pioneer 10 and 11, used Jupiter’s gravity to accelerate toward the outer Solar System, capturing the first close-up images of the planet.
                        Voyager 1 and 2 later revealed Jupiter’s rings, provided detailed views of the Galilean moons, and discovered additional satellites.
                        Missions like the Ulysses solar probe, Cassini-Huygens, and New Horizons all passed Jupiter on their way to their primary targets - the Sun (attaining a polar orbit), Saturn, and <a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a> respectively.
                        Five of the missions achieved the needed velocity to leave the Solar System, those being the two Pioneer and Voyager probes, and New Horizons.

                        NASA’s Galileo mission became the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, studying the planet and its moons for seven years before its intentional deorbit.
                        Galileo released an atmospheric probe, analyzed the composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere, and observed the dramatic impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9.
                        The Juno mission, currently extended until 2025, is the successor to the Galileo orbiter and continues to investigate Jupiter’s atmosphere, deep structure, and magnetosphere.
                        It is the second New Frontiers mission after New Horizons.
                        The extended mission has already ended, though Juno is still operational.
                        It will eventually meet the same fate as Galileo.

                        There are several upcoming missions, mostly focused on Jupiter's moons.
                        ESA’s <b>Ju</b>piter <b>Ic</b>y Moons <b>E</b>xplorer (JUICE), launched in 2023, will perform several flybys of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto before entering orbit around Ganymede.
                        NASA’s Europa Clipper, launched in 2024, is focused on Europa’s potential habitability, particularly its subsurface ocean.
                        China’s CNSA plans to launch Tianwen-4 in 2035 to study Jupiter’s magnetosphere, atmosphere, and either Ganymede or Callisto.
