                        65 Cybele is an <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> located in the outermost part of the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">main belt</a>, having its own group of asteroids.
                        It was discovered in 1861.
                        Cybele is one of the largest asteroids, having a mean diameter greater than 200 km.

                    Cybele was discovered in 1861 by E. W. Tempel at the Marseille Observatory.

                    Cybele is named after the eaarth goddess of the ancient Phrygians.
                    Originally, the name Maximiliana (after Maximilian II of Bavaria) was proposed for the asteroid by Carl August von Steinheil, who was awarded the honor of naming it by Tempel.
                    At the time, non-classical names of asteroids were not the norm, so after several astronomers opposed the name, Cybele was later chosen.
                    Nevertheless, the asteroids 45 Eugenia, 54 Aexandra, and 64 Angelina already had such non-classical names at the time of Cybele's discovery.
                    The original proposal was later used for another asteroid, 1217 Maximiliana, though in honor of astronomer Max Wolf instead.

                    Cybele is an asteroid in the outer asteroid belt.
                    The semi-major axis is 3.428 AU, the perihelion is 3.046 AU, and the aphelion is 3.810 AU.
                    It takes Cybele 6.35 years to complete one orbit.
                    The eccentricity is 0.111 and the inclination is 3.56°.
                    The rotational period of Cybele is around 6.08 hours, though some analyses have shown a period as low as 3.987 hours.

                    Cybele is part of the group of the same name that consists of 2000 known members, some forming collisional families.
                    It is the furthermost part of the outer main belt (unless the Hilda triangle is also counted), between the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances with Jupiter.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Cybele has triaxial dimensions of 297 km × 291 km × 213 km and a mean 263 km diameter.
                    An earlier study by the Japanese AKARI satellite have yielded a 300.5 km mean radius.
                    Observations show that Cybele's present shape very closely matches what would be expected if it were in hydrostatic equilibrium.

                    Cybele is a P-type asteroid, consisting of water ice, as well as organic-rich silicates, carbon and anhydrous silicates.
                    P-type asteroids are typical for the outer reaches of the asteroid belt and the <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> <a href="trojan.html">trojans</a>, and resemble distant minor planets.
