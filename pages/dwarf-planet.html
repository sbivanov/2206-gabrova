                    A dwarf planet is a celestial body that orbits the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a> and is large enough to be round due to its own gravity, but has not cleared its orbit of other objects (cleared the neighborhood).
                    This means that dwarf planets share their orbits with other bodies of similar, or greater size.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The number of known dwarf planets is not agreed upon, as there are multiple methods of  measuring  the roundness of objects.
                    According to the IAU and NASA, there are five confirmed dwarf planets in our solar system: <a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a>, <a href="eris.html">Eris</a>, <a href="haumea.html">Haumea</a>, <a href="makemake.html">Makemake</a>, and <a href="ceres.html">Ceres</a>.
                    Other objects considered dwarf planets by some are <a href="gonggong.html">Gonggong</a>, <a href="quaoar.html">Quaoar</a>, <a href="sedna.html">Sedna</a>, <a href="orcus.html">Orcus</a>, <a href="salacia.html">Salacia</a> and many more.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pluto is the biggest dwarf planet.
                    It was once considered the ninth <a href="planet.html">planet</a> in our solar system, but after the discovery of the similarly sized Eris and many more potentially round bodies, it  was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.
                    Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres were also subsequently classified as dwarf planets.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    With the exception of Ceres, dwarf planets are found beyond the orbit of <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>.
                    Such bodies are known as <a href="tno.html">trans-Neptunian objects</a>.
                    Most of them are located in an area known as the Kuiper Belt and others are part of other smaller regions, often considered part of the Kuiper belt.
                    Dwarf planet are typically made up of ice and rock and can have <a href="natural-satellite.html">moons</a> of their own.
                    Many more dwarf planets are yet to be discovered or proven to be such in our solar system and beyond.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Ceres is the first dwarf planet ever discovered.
                    It was discovered in 1801 by the Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi.
                    It was the first object to be discovered in a region between <a href="mars.html">Mars</a> and <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>, called the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">asteroid belt</a>.
                    For a while it was considered a planet before many other <a href="asteroid.html">asteroids</a> were found orbiting the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh.
                    It was considered the ninth planet in our solar system.
                    After the discovery of other bodies beyond Neptune like Eris, the number of planets, if they were recognised as such, could have been as high as a few hundred.
                    For that reason, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.
                    Eris itself was discovered in 2005 by a team of astronomers lead by Mike Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory.
                    It is the largest known dwarf planet by mass and at the time of discovery was also thought to be larger in size than Pluto.

                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Criteria">Critera</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The criteria that distinguishes dwarf planets from <a href="planet.html">planets</a> is "clearing the neighborhood".
                    This means that dwarf planets have not cleared their orbits of other objects.
                    Their orbits are shared with other bodies of similar, or greater size, and they are not the dominant object in these orbits.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    There are multiple ways of measuring the orbital dominance.
                    One way is Soter's µ, defined as the ratio between a body's mass and the mass of every other body within it's orbital zone.
                    If µ is greater than 100, then the body is a planet.
                    Other more complex ways include Stern-Levison's Λ and Margot's Π.
                    All three methods show a clear division between planets and dwarf planets.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The roundness of a minor planet is harder to prove.
                    Of the five official dwarf planets, only Ceres and Pluto were visited by spacecrafts.
                    The largest asteroids have been observed from <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> and none (apart from Ceres) are round.
                    <a href="vesta.html">Vesta</a> has been in hydrostatic equilibrium and has differentiated interior, but lost its round form after a collision event.
                    <a href="pallas.html">Pallas</a> and <a href="hygiea.html">Hygiea</a> are also close to round shapes. 
                    This rules out any other dwarf planets in the asteroid belt.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The trans-Neptunian objects are much further from Earth and their shapes can't be determined with telescopes, so many assumptions are made.
                    The smallest known rounded body, <a href="mimas.html">Mimas</a> has a diameter of roughly 400 km, which could suggest that all of the TNOs greater than that number could be round.
                    However, the largest non-round moon, <a href="proteus.html">Proteus</a>, and the second largest asteroid, Vesta, have mean diameters of 420 and 525 respectively.
                    Furthermore, it is possible for TNOs much larger than Vesta to not have been rounded.
                    Some objects like Gonggong, Quaoar and Sedna likely have differentiated interiors, while many smaller, darker bodies have low density and might have porous, undifferentiated interiors.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Mike Brown classifies numerous <a href="tno.html">TNOs</a> in different categories of certainty to be round, based on size.
                    According to him, ten TNOs are "nearly certainly" dwarf planets - Eris, Pluto, Makemake, Gonggong, Haumea, Quaoar, Sedna, Orcus, Máni and Salacia.
                    The list has not been expanded since 2018 and old entries in the list have not been updated.

                        Eris is the most massive of the dwarf planets and is slightly smaller than Pluto.
                        It's discovery lead to the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet.
                        For a time it had the nickname "Xena" after the main character of an American TV series - the nickname was chosen for it's initial letter X as in Planet X.
                        It's proper name Eris comes from the Greek goddess of discord.
                        It resides in the scattered disc and was the farthest discovered Solar System object until the discovery of 2018 VG18.
                        Unlike other TNOs that appear reddish, Eris is mostly white.
                        One moon is known to orbit Eris - <a href="dysnomia.html">Dysnomia</a>.

                        Haumea is an unusual dwarf planet.
                        It takes four hours to complete a rotation around it's axis, causing it's shape to be an ellipsoid.
                        It is named after the Hawaiian goddess of fertility.
                        Haumea has the first known ring system of a TNO.
                        There are two moons orbiting Haumea - Hiʻiaka and Namaka.

                        It was discovered in 1801 and was thought to be a planet, before other smaller bodies like Pallas, Juno, and <a href="vesta.html">Vesta</a> were discovered.

                        Cryovolcanism activity shapes the surface of the dwarf planet, thanks to which many bright spots in craters and a single mountain (Ahuna Mons) exist.
