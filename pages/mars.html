                    Mars is the fourth <a href="planet.html">planet</a> from the Sun and the second smallest in the Solar System.   
                    Mars is named after the Roman god of war. 
                    It is also known as the Red Planet, the name originating from it's red surface.
                    The planet has a similar composition to that of <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>, but with a thinner atmosphere.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Mars features some of the largest geological structures in the Solar System like the highest known mountain - Olympus Mons (21,229 m) and the largest canyon Valles Marineris. 
                    Craters are mostly concentrated in the south, where the surface is older, the biggest of which is Utopia, although the unconfirmed North Polar Basin is bigger. 
                    There is ice on Mars, most of which is at the poles, with evidences showing that liquid water might have existed at one point on the Martian surface.
                    Currently no liquid water can remain on the surface, due to the low athmospheric pressure.

                    Mars has been visited by multiple spacecraft, the first success being NASA's Mariner 4.
                    Other countries have sent their missions, including the Soviet Union (and later Russia), Japan, China and the UAE.
                    European countries under ESA have also sent missions.
                    Only the USA, the Soviet Union and China have successfully sent a lander, although the soviet Mars 3 lost connection shortly after landing.

                The first to name the planet were the Sumerians, giving it the name of the god of war and plague Nergal.
                In Ancient Greece, the planet was known as "Pyroeis" (Πυρόεις), or "Areos aster" (Ἄρεως ἀστἡρ), after the Greek god of war Ares.
                The modern Greek name is Ares (Άρης).
                The Romans also named it after their god of war Mars.
                In India the planet is called Mangala (मंगल), which is the god-personification of the planet.
                In China and neighboring countries the planet is refered to as "fire star" (火星).

                Mars has an interior similar to that of Earth. 
                It is differentiated into a crust, a rocky mantle and a metallic core.
                The crust contains mostly silicates, with common elements being (apart from silicon and oxygen) iron, magnesium and aluminium.
                The iron(III) oxide (ferric oxide) gives Mars it's red color.
                The Martian mantle is solid and rocky, but is not divided like Earth's inner and outer mantle.
                The core contains iron, nickel and sulfur.

                    Mars is seismically active, but does not feature tectonic plates like Earth.
                    There are two major volcanic regions - Tharsis and Elysium.
                    Tharsis is a region, containing most of the volcanoes on Mars.
                    Tharsis Montes, a group of three mountains - Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons - is located in the center of Tharsis.
                    Other prominent mountains are Alba Mons and Olympus Mons, which is the highest mountain known at 21,229 m above datum.
                    Elysium is located west of Tharsis, both separated by Amazonis Planitia.
                    The tallest mountain is Elysium Mons at 14.1 km above the datum.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Valles Marineris, named after Mariner 9, is a canyon east from Tharsis.
                    It is long 4,000 km, wide 200 km and deep 7 km, making it the biggest known canyon in the Solar System.
                    Many theories exist on what might have caused it's formation, like a tectonic rift, or formed by erosion by liquid water.

                The Martian surface is heavily cratered, but most craters are located in the south.
                The north contains interconnected low-lying plains like Arcadia Planitia, Acidalia Planitia and Utopia Planitia.
                This suggests that these plains may have once been covered by a large Martian ocean.
                Another big plain is Hellas Planitia, which is not connected to the other and is located in the south hemisphere.
                This is where the lowest point on Mars is.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Dark spots on Mars like Syrtis Major are albedo features significantly darker than the surrounding terrain.
                The dark colors come from the basaltic volcanic rock of the regions and the relative lack of dust.

                Water on Mars exist as ice and small quantities of vapor.
                Liquid water can hardly form on Mars, where the atmospheric pressure is less than that on Earth.
                The two biggest regions where water exists are the poles.
                The South pole also has a permanent dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) cap.

                Landforms, called outflow channels, migh have been formed by water.
                Chryse Planitia is a plain, where many of those outflow channels are located like Ares Vallis, Tiu Vallis and Kasei Valles.
                The northern hemisphere has a lower elevation and is less craterd, suggesting that an ocean might have covered the surface.

                Mars does not have a magnetosphere and as a result has a very thin atmosphere, which is getting stripped away by solar winds and ionisationof particles.
                The atmosphere consists of 96% carbon, 1.9% argon and 1.8% nitrogen, with trace amounts of oxygen, water vapors and carbon monoxide.
                Despite the high amounts of carbon dioxide, the thin atmosphere does not trap as much heat as on <a href="venus.html">Venus</a>.
                The temperatures range from −110 °C to 35 °C.
                Dust storms on Mars are the largest in the Solar System.
                They occur when Mars is close to the Sun.

                Mars has been observed since ancient times.
                The first to see Mars through a telescope was Galileo Galilei.
                Cristiaan Huygens was the first to draw a map of Mars.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                On 5 September 1877 the italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli produced a detailed map of the Martian surface during a perihelic opposition.
                By then telescopes were advanced enough to detect features on the surface.
                Schiaparelli gave names to most of those features, many still in use.
                One feature he noticed was channels on the martian surface.
                Until early 20th century it was believed that those channels were real, but with the improvement of telescopes, these features couldn't be seen.
                The channels were identified as an optical illusions.

                Many missions were conducted, including flybys, orbiters, landers, rovers and even a helicopter.
                The Soviet Union were the first with a program to Mars.
                NASA's Mariner 4 completed the first successful flyby, although the soviet Mars 1 lost communication before it's flyby.
                Mariner 9 was the first to orbit Mars, two weeks before the soviet Mars 2.
                Mars 2 was successful at deploying an orbiter, but lander and rover crashed into the martian surface.
                The next Mars mission was the first to make a soft land, but shortly after lost communication.
                NASA's Viking 1 on the other hand landed and was operational for 2245 sols.

                The last Soviet missions were the unsuccessful Phobos 1 and 2 missions.
                Phobos 2 managed to reach a Phobos orbit, before it lost communications and failed to deploy a lander and a rover.

                NASA continued with the missions, launching Mars Pathfinder, which carried the rover Sojourner.
                It was the first rover to operate on Mars.
                Since then, NASA has sent four other rovers - Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity and Perseverance.
                The Mars 2020 mission, along with Perseverance, brough Ingenuity - a small robotic helicopter, which operated the first flight on Mars.

                Since the fall of the Soviet Union, other agencies launched their own missions over the years.
                Rosaviacosmos, later Roskosmos, launched two missions - Mars 96 and Phobos-Grunt, both unsuccessful.
                The Japanese ISAS failed to send their Mars orbiter Nozomi.
                ESA has two missions, both still in operation - Mars Express and ExoMars 2016.
                The probe Rosetta used Mars gravity assist as a way to reach the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.
                The Chinese CNSA has one mission (apart from the unsuccessful Yinghuo 1 that was part of Phobos Grunt) to Mars - Tianwen-1.
                This way China became the second to operate a rover on Mars with Zhurong.
                ISRO - India's national space agency - was the fourth agency to send a spacecraft to MARS after NASA, the soviet space program and ESA.
                The Mars orbiter Mangalyaan has the lowest cost of all the missions to Mars.
                The Dubai-based MBRSC has one orbiter around Mars - Hope.

                Mars does not have life forms, but might have done in the past.
                Current missions of NASA are studying the surface for signs of life on Mars.
                The next ExoMars mission by ESA (in collaboration with Roscosmos) is planned to deploy the Rosalind Franklin rover, with the primary objetive to drill and collect samples for analysis.
                The mission was postponed due to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

                Plans for colonising Mars were proposed multiple times.
                NASA and CNSA both plan on sending people on Mars as early as the 2030s.
                SpaceX, a privately held company, has proposed it's own missions to Mars with the intent of colonising and settling the <a href="planet.html">planet</a>.
