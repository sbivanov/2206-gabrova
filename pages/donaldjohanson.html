                        52246 Donaldjohanson is an inner <a href="asteroid-belt.html">main belt</a> <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a>, part of the Erigone family.
                        It was discovered in 1981.
                        Donaldjohanson is a contact binary made of two lobes with different sizes.

                    Donaldjohanson is named after the paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, who discovered the Lucy fossils.
                    The name was selected after the asteroid was chosen as a target for the Lucy mission by NASA.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Donaldjohanson is located in the inner asteroid belt.
                    The semi-major axis is 2.383 AU, the perihelion is 1.936 AU, and the aphelion is 2.830 AU.
                    It takes Donaldjohanson 3.68 years to complete one orbit.
                    The eccentricity is 0.187 and the inclination is 4.424°.
                    The rotational period is slow, around 251 hours, or 10.46 days.

                    Donaldjohanson has triaxial dimensions of 8 × 3.5 km and a mean 3.90 km diameter.
                    Donaldjohanson is a contact binary more than twice as long as it is wide.
                    The two lobes are of different sizes, with Olduvai Lobus being around two times the size of Afar Lobus.
                    Both are connected by a neck, Windover Collum.

                    Donaldjohanson is a C-type asteroid, rich in carbonaceous material.

                    The surface of the two lobes of Donaldjohanson are more heavily cratered than its younger neck.
                    It can be explained by the filling up with regolith.
                    However, it is encircled by a ridge, named Luzia Dorsum.
                    Several craters and boulders on Olduvai Lobus are also named.

                    Donaldjohanson was visited by the Lucy spacecraft on on 20 April 2025 with a closest approach distance of 960 km.
                    This is the second target after <a href="dinkinesh.html">Dinkinesh</a>.
                    Lucy is now on its way to the Greek camp, starting with the trojan Eurybates.
