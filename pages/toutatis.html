                        4179 Toutatis is a <a href="nea.html">near-Earth</a> and potentially hazardous asteroid, part of the Apollo group.
                        It was discovered in 1989 and measures around 2 and a half km in diameter.
                        Toutatis has made several close approaches since then, most notably in 1992 and 2004 - 9 and 4 lunar distances respectively.
                        Toutatis was visited by the Chinese Chang'e 2 <a href="moon.html">lunar</a> mission.

                    Toutatis was discovered in 1989 by French astronomer Christian Pollas at Caussols.
                    Before that the <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> has been briefly sighted in 1934, but got lost afterwards.

                    Toutatis is named after Teutates, a Celtic tribal god.
                    The name was chosen in particular for its appearance in the French comics Asterix, where the catchphrase "Par Toutais!" appears throughout the series.

                    Toutatis is a near-Earth asteroid, part of the Apollo group.
                    The semi-major axis is 2.532 AU, the perihelion is 0.940 AU, and the aphelion is 4.124 AU, making it a <a href="mars.html">Mars</a> crosser.
                    Toutatis completes one orbit every 4.03 years.
                    It has a high eccentricity of 0.629 and the inclination is 0.446°.
                    The rotation of Toutatis is slow and complex, due to the YORP effect.
                    While it has a rotation period around its long axis of 5.38 days, the long axis itself is precessing with a period of 7.38 days.
                    That way it appears to be tumbling.

                    Toutatis is a potentially hazardous asteroid.
                    The Earth minimal orbital insertion distance is 0.0064 AU, or 2.5 lunar distances.
                    For the next several centuries, Toutatis poses no collision risk with <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.
                    It is also an Alinda asteroid, meaning it is in a mean-motion 3:1 orbital resonance with <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> and close to a 1:4 resonance with Earth.

                    Toutatis has dimensions of 4.26 × 2.03 × 1.70 km and a mean 2.45 km diameter.
                    It is a contact binary made of two conjoined parts, with one part being two times larger than the other.
                    Early Earth-based observations did not show a clear image and it was also thought to be a binary of two mutually orbiting bodies.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Toutatis is an S-type asteroid, consisting of mostly silicates.
                    It is most likely a rubble pile with many fragments and a high porosity.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The larger lobe of Toutatis is marked by a wide 805 m basin that is slowly filling up with loose regolith.
                    It is possible that more than one impactor may have created it.
                    The ridge around the basin appears to have a high density of lineaments.
                    Other ridges outside the basin are possibly the result from the stress energy from the impact.
                    More than fifty craters have been identified, with the largest measuring around 532 m.

                    Toutatis has been previously observed with radar imaging from the Arecibo Observatory and the Goldstone Solar System Radar during its numerous close approaches.
                    The Chinese lunar probe Chang'e 2 made a flyby of Toutatis on 13 December 2012 after departing the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>-Earth L2 point.
                    Chang'e 2's closest approach was 3.2 km.
