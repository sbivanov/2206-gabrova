                        65803 Didymos is a sub-kilometer <a href="nea.html">near-Earth asteroid</a> that is also potentially hazardous.
                        It has one known <a href="natural-satellite.html">moon</a> called Dimorphos.
                        The moon itself was the target of the DART impactor, the first <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> deflection test.
                        The impact successfully altered Dimorphos’s orbit around Didymos.
                        The ESA mission Hera is on its way to the system to study further the results from the DART impact.

                    Didymos was discovered in April 1996 at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Tucson, Arizona during the Spacewatch survey.
                    Later radar images taken at the Goldstone and Arecibo observatories found a small moon orbiting Didymos.

                    Didymos is the Greek word for "twin".
                    The name was chosen by Joseph Montani of the University of Arizona after the discovery of its moon.

                    Didymos is a near-Earth asteroid and a <a href="mars.html">Mars</a> crosser with a 1.64 AU semi major axis, a 1.013 AU perihelion and a 2.27 AU aphelion.
                    Because of the perihelion, Didymos is an edge case between the Apollo (less than 1.017 AU) and Amor (greater than 1.017 AU) groups.
                    Didymos completes one orbit every 2.11 years.
                    The eccentricity of Didymos is 0.38 and the inclination is 3.41°.
                    The rotational period is around 2.26 hours.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Didymos is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid.
                    The <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) is 0.0403 AU, or 15.7 lunar distances.
                    In other words, there is no immediate risk from a collision with Didymos in the near future,
                    The same applies for Mars, where the MOID is 7.8 lunar distances.

                    Didymos has triaxial dimesions of 851 × 849 × 620 m, or 765 m as a mean diameter.
                    The asteroid is oblate and bulged around the equator.
                    The bulge is thanks to tidal forces caused by Dimorphos.

                    The feature is characterized by rocky fragments, known collectively as regolith.
                    They are relatively large for a body the size of Didymos and are thus defining features.
                    Two boulders (saxa) have been named on the surface of Didymos.

                    Didymos has one moon - Dimorphos.
                    It's name in Greek stands for "two-forms", refering to its state before and after the planned impact.
                    Dimorphos is the smallest natural celestial object to be visited by a spacecraft so far, with dimensions of only 151 meters in diameter.
                    The surface of Dimorphos is  that of a rubber pile and has formed from the rapid rotation of Didymos.
                    It was the target for the DART planetary mission, the first of its type.

                        The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) is the first of its type, launched in 2021 to test asteroid deflection.
                        It reached the Didymos system, particularly the moon Dimorphos.
                        The small size of Dimorphos made it a perfect test target for the first ever asteroid deflection test.
                        Originally, it was expected that the collision will reduce Dimorphos's orbital period with 73 seconds.
                        However, the impact reduced the orbital period with 33 minutes and ejected a million kilograms of material, far exceeding expectations.
                        A follow-up mission by ESA, Hera, is on its way to the system to further investigate the consequences of the impact.
