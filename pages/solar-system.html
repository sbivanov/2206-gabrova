                        The Solar System is the planetary system of the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>. 
                        It formed about 4.6 billion years ago with the collapse of a dense region of a molecular cloud, which created the Sun and a protoplanetary disc that eventually formed the orbiting bodies. 
                        The system features eight known <a href="planet.html">planets</a> that orbit the Sun. 
                        The closest four ones - <a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a>, <a href="venus.html">Venus</a>, <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>, and <a href="mars.html">Mars</a> - are smaller in size and consist mostly of solid materials like rocks and metals, while the outer four - <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>, <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>, <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a>, and <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a> - are much bigger in size and are mostly made of hydrogen, helium, or include other compounds that are refered to as volatiles.
                        Apart from planets, the Solar System includes many smaller bodies like <a href="natural-satellite.html">natural satellites</a>, <a href="asteroid.html">asteroids</a>, <a href="comet.html">comets</a>, centaurs and meteoroids.
