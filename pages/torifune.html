                    98943 Torifune is a sub-kilometer <a href="nea.html">near-Earth asteroid</a>, part of the Apollo group.
                    It was discovered in 2001 and measures around half a kilometer in diameter.
                    Torifune will be visited by the Hayabusa2# mission, an extension of the sample return mission to <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> <a href="ryugu.html">Ryugu</a>.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Torifune, meaning "bird ship" is named after Ame-no-torifune, a Japanese deity and its ship that is fast as a flying bird.
                    This name was selected as a part of a public naming campaign.
                    The name refers to the upcoming fast flyby of the asteroid, similar to the mythological ship.

                    Torifune is a near-Earth asteroid, part of the Apollo group.
                    The semi-major axis is 1.032 AU, the perihelion is 0.806 AU, and the aphelion is 1.259 AU.
                    Torifune completes one orbit every 1.05 years.
                    The eccentricity is 0.219 and the inclination is 4.807°.
                    The rotational period of Torifune is around 5.02 hours.
                    The <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> minimal orbital intersection distance is 0.08 AU, or 32 lunar distances and poses no risk.

                    Torifune has a mean diameter of 465 km with a long axis at least 2.7 times its short one.
                    It is either a singular elongated unit, or a contact binary.

                    The surface of Torifune will remain unknown until the Hayabusa2# flyby, unless a technical error arises from the rapid movement of the spacecraft.

                    Torifune was selected as the upcoming target of Hayabusa2# in 2020.
                    Previously, Hayabusa2 successfully returned a capsule of regolith sample from asteroid Ryugu and will make two asteroid flybys.
                    The Torifune one will be performed at a high relative speed of 5 km/s in July 2026.
                    The second target will be the 11 km asteroid 1998 KY26.
