                    Planets are round astronomical bodies, smaller than <a href="star.html">stars</a>.
                    According to the IAU, a planet is a celestial body that:

                    <li>has cleared the neighborhood around it's orbit.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    There are 8 planets in the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a> - <a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a>, <a href="venus.html">Venus</a>, <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>, <a href="mars.html">Mars</a>, <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>, <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>, <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a> and <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>. 
                    The first four are known as terrestrial planets, Jupiter and Saturn are called gas giants and Uranus and Neptune are ice giants.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Other objects used to be considered planets, but were later considered as completely different bodies. 
                    For example, the Sun was considered a planet orbiting the Earth, but was later discovered that it is a star. 
                    The <a href="natural-satellite.html">satellites</a> of planets like Earth's <a href="moon.html">Moon</a>, or the Jovian, Saturnian, Uranian and Neptunian moons were also considered planets for some time.

                    The same can be said for the <a href="asteroid.html">asteroids</a> in the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">Asteroid Belt</a>, or objects like Pluto. 
                    The biggest asteroid - <a href="ceres.html">Ceres</a>, the <a href="tno.html">Trans-Neptunian objects</a> <a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a>, <a href="eris.html">Eris</a>, <a href="haumea.html">Haumea</a>, <a href="makemake.html">Makemake</a> and many more are called <a href="dwarf-planet.html">dwarf planets</a>. 
                    The difference is that unlike regular planets, dwarf planets do not make up the majority of the mass in their orbit.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In ancient times, in addition to the Earth, five of the planets were known to man, as they were close enough to be observed with the naked eye. 
                    Those five, the Sun and the Moon were the "seven classical planets". 
                    The term planet comes from the Ancient Greek word "πλανῆται" (planetai), meaning "wanderers", refering to their movement in the sky.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In the XVI century, the polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus presented a mathematical model of a heliocentric system, where planets revolved around the Sun. 
                    This meant that in addition to Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, Earth was also a planet, while the Sun and the Moon weren't.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 1781, William Herschel discovered a new planet - Uranus, adding a seventh planet. 
                    The next century saw the discovery of many new "planets", but were later categorised as a new class of bodies - asteroids. 
                    The last planet discovered was Neptune in 1846.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    There were speculations, that a ninth planet existed. 
                    In 1930 this planet was believed to be the newly discovered Pluto. 
                    But after the discovery of many smaller objects beyond Neptune, Pluto's satellite <a href="charon.html">Charon</a> and a "tenth" planet Eris with it's moon <a href="dysnomia.html">Dysnomia</a> lead to the 2006 definition by the International Astronomical Union of what a planet is. 
                    According to it, Pluto, Eris and the other objects didn't meet the last criteria - to "clear the neighborhood", or in other words - to make up most of the mass within their orbits.
