                    Neptune is the eight <a href="planet.html">planet</a> from the Sun in the Solar System. 
                    It is the fourth biggest planet in the Solar System, and one of two ice giants, the other being i<a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a>.
                    Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU from it.
                    It is named after the Roman sea god, the equivalent of the Greek Poseidon. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The unexplained deviations from the expected orbit of Uranus lead to speculations about the existence of an eight planet.
                    Thus Neptune was discovered in 1846 by Johann Galle. 
                    It is not visible to the naked eye and was discovered by mathematical predictions. 
                    The biggest Neptunian satellite - Triton was found shortly after and the other 13 we know of today were located until the next century.
                    Neptune has been visited by Voyager 2 in 1989.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The atmosphere of Neptune is composed of hydrogen and helium, but unlike <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> and <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>, it has a higher amount of ices such as water, methane and ammonia.
                    This distinction makes Neptune an ice giant like Uranus.
                    Neptune has a more active atmosphere than that of Uranus and has more features.
                    One such weather phenomena was the Great Dark Spot, similar to the Great Red Spot of Jupiter, observed by Voyager 2. 
                    It has since disappeared, although smaller dark spots are now seen by the Hubble Space Telescope.
                    Neptune also has a ring system like the other giants.
                    The rings are faint and consist of dust.

            <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Name">Name</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Neptune is named after the Roman sea god Neptune (Neptunus in Latin). 
                The name was chosen by Urbain Le Verrier, who predicted the location of the planet.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In Greek the planet is named "Poseidonas"(Ποσειδώνας) after the Greek counterpart of Neptune - Poseidon. 
                Other languages that call the planet after a water deity are Hindi, calling it "Varun" (वरुण) after Varuna, Māori, calling the planet "Tangaroa" and Nahuatl, naming it "Tlāloccītlalli" after the rain god Tlāloc.
                In Hebrew, the planet was given the name "Rahab" (רהב) after a Biblical sea monster.
                In Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and Korean, the planet can be translated as "ocean king star" (海王星 in Mandarin).
                A similar name is the Mongolian "Dalain van" (Далайн ван, literally "sea king").
            </p>
            <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Discovery">Discovery</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The planet <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a> was discovered by William Herschel in 1781, but it's orbit couldn't be explained by Newton's law of universal gravitation.
                Astronomers were hypothesising an eight planet affecting the path of Uranus.
                The french mathematician Urbain Le Verrier calculated the coordinates of the mysterious planet in 1846.
                At the Berlin Observatory, the german Johannes Galle worked on Le Verre's predictions and on the night of September 23–24 the same year, he discovered the planet.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Neptune has been observed before, but was not recognised as a planet.
                Galileo was the first to notice the existence of Neptune, but it was in retrograde at the time of observing, so he mistook it for a star.
                John Herschel, son of William Herschel also has observed Neptune in 1830 and although the planet would have appeared as a small blue disc, he also thought it was a star.

            <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="OrbitAndRotation">Orbit and rotation</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun at 30.1 AU.
                It takes Neptune an average of 164.79 years to complete an orbit.
                The perihelion distance is 29.81 AU and the aphelion distance is 30.33 AU.
                The elliptical orbit of Neptune is inclined 1.77° in relation to that of Earth. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Since Neptune is made of gas, the planet rotates differentially.
                At the Equator, the atmosphere rotates with a period of 18 hours, whereas the poles have a rotational period of 12 hours.
                The axial tilt is 28.32°, similar to that of Earth.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                There are many objects that are farther from the Sun than Neptune, called <a href="tno.html">trans-Neptunian objects</a>.
                Part of those objects that have a low eccentricity make up the Kuiper belt.
                Kuiper belt are split into classical (cubewanos) and resonant.
                The resonant KBOs are in a resonance with Neptune - 1:2 (twotinos), 2:3 (plutinos), 3:4, 3:5, 4:7 or 2:5.
                Pluto, the largest dwarf planet, is a plutino and because of it's resonance with Neptune, it would not collide despite crossing the Neptunian orbit.

            <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="Size">Size</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Neptune has a mass of 1.0243×10^26 kg - it is 17 times the mass of <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> but only 1/19th that of Jupiter. 
                Neptune's equatorial radius is nearly four times that of Earth.
                Like <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a>, Neptune is an ice giant, because it has higher concentrations of volatiles (ices) than <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> and <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>. 
                <a href="exoplanet.html">Exoplanets</a> with a similar size are refered to as "Neptunes".

            <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="InternalStructureAndAtmosphere">Internal structure and atmosphere</h3>
                Neptune has a similar structure to that of Uranus.
                The atmosphere at high altitudes consists of 80% hydrogen and 19% helium, with trace amounts of methane.
                It is the methane that gives the blue color of Neptune.
                At lower levels, the amount of volatiles like water, methane and ammonia increases.
                The atmosphere is divided into a troposphere, a stratosphere, a thermosphere and an exosphere.
                Clouds vary in composition based on altitude - methane clouds are highest in the atmosphere, followed by hydrogen sulfide clouds between one and five bars, ammonia clouds over five bars and water clouds deep in the atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The Neptunian mantle is made of ices at a state of critical fluids.
                Water molecules break down into hydrogen and oxygen ions and rains of diamonds are formed from methane under the high pressure
                The core is likely a supercritical fluid mix of iron, nickel and silicates, 1.2 times more massive than Earth.
            <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Climate">Climate</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Neptune weather is more intense than that on Uranus, due to higher internal heating.
                Winds on Neptune are very dynamic and can reach supersonic speed.
                More precicely, wind speeds vary between 20 m/s in the easterly direction to 325 m/s westward, with high altitude clouds exceeding 400 m/s.
                The long orbital period of Neptune causes seasons to last for years.
                This leads to effects like higher temperatures at one the poles that is facing the Sun.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                First seen during the Voyager 2 flyby, The Great Dark Spot was a storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
                When Hubble Space Telescope observed Neptune five years later, the storm did not appear.
                Such storms form regularly and last for months, more recently, in 2018, two storms were spotted in the northern hemisphere.
                It is believed that these vortexes form in the troposphere.

                    The biggest satellite - Triton was discovered just 17 years after the discovery of Neptune. 
                    It is believed to be a dwarf planet caught by the gravitation of Neptune, because of it's retrograde orbit. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    All of the other satellites have an irregular shape.
                    The second discovered moon, Nereid, is an irregular moon with a high 0.7512 eccentricity and a apoapsis seven times the periapsis.
                    More moons were discovered by Voyager 2.
                    The biggest of them is Proteus, whis is the biggest we know of with an irregular shape, larger than Saturn's Mimas, which is round.
                    Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea are within the rings of Neptune.
                    Larissa was the last discovered in 1989.
                    Since then six more moons were discovered in 2003, 2004 and 2013.

               Voyager 2 was the only spacecraft to visit Neptune.
               After a flyby of Saturn and Uranus, Neptune was the next potential objet to be visited.
               Voyager 2 reached Neptune on 25 August 1989.
               The spacecraft observed Neptune's atmosphere, rings, magnetosphere and moons. 
               Since the visit, Voyager 2 has left the Solar System.
               Multiple new missions were proposed, but none are yet approved.
