                        21 Lutetia is an <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> in the inner <a href="asteroid-belt.html">asteroid belt</a>.
                        It was discovered in 1852 by Hermann Goldschmidt.
                        Lutetia is of the special M spectral type, or metal-rich, albeit more rocky than expected.
                        The ESA Rosetta mission flew by this asteroid while on its way to <a href="comet.html">comet</a> 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

                    The name Lutetia comes from the old Latin name of the city of Paris.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Lutetia is located in the inner asteroid belt at 2.435 AU from the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>, with a 2.037 AU perihelion and a 2.833 AU aphelion.
                    The orbital period is 3.80 years.
                    The orbit has an eccentricity of 0.163 and an inclination of 3.064°.
                    Lutetia's rotational period is 8.17 hours and is tilted 96°, meaning it rotates in retrograde, nearly paralel to the ecliptic, in a similar manner to the <a href="planet.html">planet</a> <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a>.

                    Lutetia is irregularly shaped and has triaxial dimensions of 121 × 101 × 75 km with a mean diameter of 98 km.
                    At the time, it was the largest asteroid imaged up-close by a spacecraft.

                    Lutetia is an M-type asteroid, meaning it is rich in metal, particularly iron and nickel.
                    However, it is not nearly pure metal as originally thought.
                    For one, it has a lower radar albedo of 0.24 compared to other such asteroids like <a href="psyche.html">Psyche</a>.
                    Further spectral analysis has also shown the presence of hydrated silicates.
                    Nevertheless, Lutetia has a relatively high density of 3.4 g/cm^3.
                    Therefore, the metal is most likely in the form of metal-rich silicates like enstatite (magnesium silicate).
                    Analogues of Lutetia are most likely enstatite chondrite or metal-rich carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The surface of Lutetia is covered by many impact craters and intersected by fractures, scarps and grooves
                    Only the northern side has been observed, where seven geological regions have been defined.
                    The oldest regions of Lutetia are Achaia and Noricum, featuring the highest count of asteroids, while Baetica is the youngest.
                    Within Narbonensis Regio is the largest 45 km crater - Massilia.
                    It is suspected that a similarly-sized crater, dubbed Suspicio, exist at the south pole.
                    The large impacts have not destroyed the asteroid, but instead produced fractures, ruling out Lutetia being a rubber pile.

                    Lutetia was one of two secondary asteroid flyby targets for the Rosetta spacecraft by ESA, the other being asteroid <a href="steins.html">Šteins</a>.
                    On 10 July 2010, it flew by 3168 km at its closest and obtained several images of the northern half before going to comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
