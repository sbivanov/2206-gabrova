                    A natural satellite is an astronomical body that orbits a <a href="planet.html">planet</a>, a minor planet, or another satellite. 
                    Natural satellites are also called moons.

                    Six of the eight planets in the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a> have at least one satellite. 
                    Many of the known <a href="dwarf-planet.html">dwarf planets</a> also have satellites, as well as some <a href="asteroid.html">asteroids</a>.

                    <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>'s <a href="moon.html">Moon</a> is the first known satellite. 
                    Because other satellites weren't discovered, the Moon was considered a planet. 
                    Galileo's discovery of the Galilean moons of <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> lead to the creation of the new class of objects. 
                    The first one to call them "satellites" was Johannes Kepler.

                    The launch of Sputnik marked the first artificial object in Earth's orbits. 
                    Satellites of planets had to be distinguished between natural and artificial for the first time.
