                        951 Gaspra is an <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> from the inner <a href="asteroid-belt.html">asteroid belt</a>, part of the Flora family.
                        It was discovered in 1916 and later became the first asteroid ever to be visited by a spacecraft, when the Galileo spacecraft approached it on its way to <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> in 1991.
                        Gaspra has a composition rich in olivine, possibly because of the partial differentiation of the parent body, and a less cratered surface.

                    Gaspra was discovered by Russian astronomer Grigory N. Neujmin at the Simiez Observatory in Crimea in 1916.

                    Gaspra has triaxial measurements of 18.2 km × 10.5 km × 8.9 km and a mean diameter of 12.2 km.
                    It has an elongated and angular shape.

                    Gaspra is an S-type asteroid.
                    Compared to other such asteroids, Gaspra is richer in olivine.
                    This composition suggests that the parent body of the Flora family was partially differentiated.
                    The mass and the density haven't been determined during the Galileo visit.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Gaspra does not have large craters, likely because the Flora collision was relatively recent - 200 million years ago.
                    The largest named crater (Saratoga) measures only 2.8 km in diameter.
                    For that reason relatively flat regions like Dunne Regio remain.
                    Apart from small impact craters, several grooves up to 2.5 km in length mark the surface.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Gaspra was the first asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft in 1991 by the Galileo mission, while on its way to Jupiter.
                    Initially, Gaspra's position was only known to within about 200 km and the camera's field of view was only about 5° across.
                    This posed a challenge, as the encounter would bear no results.
                    This lead to the implementation of a pioneering robot localization campaign. This was successful and allowed the spacecraft to obtain images from as close as 5,300 km.
                    After this flyby, Galileo visited one more asteroid - <a href="ida.html">243 Ida</a>.
