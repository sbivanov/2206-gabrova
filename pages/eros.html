                        433 Eros is a <a href="nea.html">near-Earth asteroid</a>, member of the Amor group.
                        It was the first <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> discovered near <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> and is one of the largest in that population.
                        It is named after the Greek god of erotic love and desire.
                        Eros is a solid, undifferentiated body with a homogeneous interior, rather than a rubble pile.
                        The asteroid has been visited by the first spacecraft dedicated to studying asteroids - NEAR Shoemaker.

                    Eros was discovered in 1898 Gustav Witt, director of the Urania Observatory in Berlin, and independently on the same day by Auguste H.P. Charlois at Nice, France.
                    Witt's discovery was accidental, instead conducting a two-hour photographic exposure of the asteroid 185 Eunike.
                    The image he produced showed a 0.4 mm image trail, and observations on the following evening identified the object has moved significantly.
                    Less than two weeks later, computations made by Adolf J. Berberich showed that the object's orbit brought it well inside the orbit of <a href="mars.html">Mars</a>, making it the first-known near-Earth asteroid.

                    Eros is a member of the Amor group of near-Earth asteroids, having a semi-major axis of 1.46 AU.
                    It is also a Mars-crossing asteroid with a perihelion of 1.13 AU and an aphelion of 1.78 AU.
                    The eccentricity is 0.22 and the inclination is 10.83°.
                    Eros has a 1.76 year orbital period and a 5.27 hour rotational period.

                        Eros has an elongated peanut-like shape with dimensions 34.4 × 11.2 × 11.2 km, averaging around 16.84 in diameter.
                        It is the second largest near-Earth asteroid after Ganymed.

                        Eros is an S-type asteroid consisting mostly of silicate rock.
                        Data from the NEAR spacecraft suggests that it could contain 20 billion tonnes of aluminum and similar amounts of metals that are rare on Earth, including gold and platinum.

                        The surface of Eros is covered by many craters, some exceptionally large.
                        One significant impact has resulted in 40 percent of the surface being left without large craters.
                        This area has been named Charlois Regio and the crater - Himeros.
                        It is so large that it has the shape of a saddle.
                        Another large crater is Psyche, opposite of Himeros.
                        Impacts have also resulted in seismic shockwaves.
                        One thrust fault, Hinks Dorsum, outlines the Himeros crater.
                        Dust ponds are also observed in small craters on Eros.

                        The first dedicated asteroid mission was Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) Shoemaker, launched in 1996, which first passed by the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">main-belt</a> <a href="mathilde.html">Mathilde</a>, after which it made a rendezvous of asteroid Eros in 1998.
                        The probe then entered orbit in 2000.
                        After one year in orbit, the spacecraft landed on the surface and transmited data for two weeks.
                        NEAR Shoemaker studied the asteroid and its bulk properties, composition, mineralogy, morphology, internal mass distribution, and magnetic field.
                        The landing is also the first feasibility study of how to design an instrument to be used on a rover that could select samples from the surface, look for the presence of water, or map the surface for the purpose of future mining.
                        This mission allowed for the future sample returns of asteroids like <a href="itokawa.html">Itokawa</a>, <a href="ryugu.html">Ryugu</a>, and <a href="bennu.html">Bennu</a>.
