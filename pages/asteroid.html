                    An asteroid is a minor planet that is within, or shares the orbits of <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>.
                    Asteroids consist of materials like carbonates, organic material, silicates, and metals, and have less ice than minor planets beyond Jupiter, like <a href="centaur.html">centaurs</a>, or <a href="tno.html">trans-neptunian objects</a>.
                    The biggest concentration of asteroids is the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">asteroid belt</a> between <a href="mars.html">Mars</a> and Jupiter, where the biggest asteroids like <a href="ceres.html">Ceres</a>, <a href="vesta.html">Vesta</a>, <a href="pallas.html">Pallas</a>, and <a href="hygiea.html">Hygiea</a> are located.
                    Ohter populations of asteroids are Jupiter<a href="trojan.html">trojans</a> that were drawn by the planet's strong gravity into the stable L4 and L5 points, and the Hilda triangle, an intermediate region of the outer belt.
                    There are also many scattered asteroids that cross, or approach the orbits of the inner planets like <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> and Mars.
                    The <a href="nea.html">near-Earth asteroids</a> are of greater interest because many of them are potentially hazardous and could strike Earth.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Multiple missions were sent to asteroids for a number of reasons, including more general missions to study them from a distance, sample returns, and even asteroid deflection tests.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 1596, Johannes Kepler assumed that there must be a <a href="planet.html">planet</a> between Mars and Jupiter, due to the gap between the planets. 
                    Three centuries later, in 1801, one object was discovered in the search for the missing planet. 
                    It was named <a href="ceres.html">Ceres</a> after the Roman goddess of harvest.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Soon, other objects were discovered - Pallas, Juno, <a href="vesta.html">Vesta</a>, and Astraea. 
                    William Herschel suggested the term "asteroid" (star-like), since their apparent sizes were smaller than those of stars.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    First asteroid to be discovered outside the main belt is the Mars crosser Aethra, which was lost after 22 days of observation, eventually getting rediscovered in 1922.
                    In 1875, the asteroid Hilda was discovered, being part of the Hilda asteroids.
                    Similarly, the asteroid Thule was discovered in 1888, which is even further away from the asteroid belt and closer to Jupiter.
                    These two are often considered part of the outer main belt, but their respective groups are unique, with the Hildas forming a triangle with points around Jupiter's L3, 4, and 5 points.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Until then, asteroid discoveries were significantly cumbersome for astronomers, some even calling them "vermin of the skies" for getting away into more significant observations.
                    The best visual discoverer at the time was Johann Palisa, who discovered 122 asteroids during his lifetime.
                    He worked closely with Max Wolf, who pioneered the use of photography to discover asteroids since 1891.
                    He alone discovered 248 asteroids.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The first near-Earth asteroid to be discovered was Eros in 1898.
                    Achiles was the first trojan of Jupiter to be discovered in 1906 by Wolf himself.
                    New asteroids were discovered at a much higher rate, requiring more complex provisional naming schemes before getting approved by the Minor Planet Center.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Eventually, many much smaller asteroids were being discovered with greater technology.
                    This has proven crucial in the cataloguing of near-Earth asteroids that are potentially hazardous and could strike Earth.
                    DART, a mission by NASA, was the first to change the orbit of an asteroid, albeit a small one (Didymos's moon Dimorphos.)
                    A potential use of asteroids, particularly metal-rich ones, is asteroid mining.
                    The NASA mission Psyche is on its way to the asteroid of the same name to study its composition and formation.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Asteroids can be categorized in several ways.
                    According to color, albedo and spectral shape, asteroids can be classified into three broad classes - C (carbonaceous), S (stony/silicaceous), and X (other).
                    This is known as the Tholen classification, and is one of the most common spectral classifications.
                    These three also include several smaller ones, like the metallic M class (part of X-class).

                        The asteroid belt is a region in the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a>, located roughly between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. 
                        It contains the highest concentration of asteroids and is roughly divided into three subbelts.

                        The inner main belt asteroids are located within the Kirkwood gap that corresponds with 3:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter.

                    They are named after characters from Greek mythology that have fought in the Trojan war, hence the name.
                    The largest L4 trojans have Greek names, while the L5 have Trojan names.
                    Exceptions are Hektor (a Trojan prince) and Patroclus (a Greek hero), which are part of their respective enemy camp, as they were named before the convention.
                    Hektor is the biggest of the trojan asteroids and is the 12th biggest overall.
                    The Lucy mission by NASA is expected to visit several Trojan asteroids, starting with Eurybates in 2027.

                        Due to their proximity to Earth, they are of significant interest and are easier to detect than other small families near other planets.
                        There are four distinct groups.

                    There are several groups of orbit-crossing asteroids apart from Earth crossers (Apollo and Aten groups).
                    Many asteroids are part of several of those groups, as they cross the orbits of multiple planets.
                    Mars crossers are asteroids that have orbits crossing those of Mars, but are not necessarily NEAs.
                    Every Venus and Mercury crosser is also considered a near-Earth asteroid.
                    A remarkable example is Phaeton, which has the smallest known perihelion of a named asteroid.
                    It is a member of the Apollo group of NEAs and a potentially-hazardous asteroid, as well as a Mercury, Venus, and Mars crosser.

                    On its way to the system, the spacecraft has already encountered the main-belt asteroids Dinkinesh and Donaldjohanson.
                    When it reaches the Greek camp, it will make flybys of four asteroids, and then go to the Trojan camp, making a flyby of Patroclus.

                    Another NASA mission on its way to an asteroid is Psyche.
                    It will enter orbit around the asteroid of the same name for 20 months.
                    The reason that Psyche was selected for the mission is due to its metallic composition.
                    While Lutetia, a previously visited asteroid, is an M-type spectra, data suggests that it is much richer in metals.
                    Psyche will see if Psyche is an exposed metal core of a protoplanet, or a stone with regolith consisting of metal-rich compounds.

                    JAXA is sending a tech demonstration spacecraft DESTINY+ to the asteroid Phaethon, parent body of the Geminids meteor shower.
                    It will collect samples from the dust it leaves behind.
                    Another upcoming mission is MBR Explorer, planned by the UAE Space Agency.
                    It will fly by six asteroids before landing on a seventh, Justitia, examining the prospects of asteroid mining.
                    Justitia is an unusually red asteroid, suggesting it is tholin-rich and has likely migrated from the outer Solar System.
