                    An asteroid is a minor planet that is within, or shares the orbits of <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>.
                    Asteroids consist of materials like carbonates, silicates, and metals, and have less ice than minor planets beyond Jupiter, like <a href="centaur.html">centaurs</a>, or <a href="tno.html">trans-neptunian objects</a>.
                    The biggest concentration of asteroids is the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">asteroid belt</a> between <a href="mars.html">Mars</a> and Jupiter, where the biggest asteroids like <a href="ceres.html">Ceres</a>, <a href="vesta.html">Vesta</a>, <a href="pallas.html">Pallas</a>, and <a href="hygiea.html">Hygiea</a> are located.
                    Multiple missions were sent to asteroids for a number of reasons, including more general missions to study them from a distance, sample returns, and even asteroid deflection.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 1596, Johannes Kepler assumed that there must be a <a href="planet.html">planet</a> between Mars and Jupiter, due to the gap between the planets. 
                    Three centuries later, in 1801, one object was discovered in the search for the missing planet. 
                    It was named <a href="ceres.html">Ceres</a> after the Roman goddess of harvest.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Soon, other objects were discovered - Pallas, Juno, <a href="vesta.html">Vesta</a>, and Astraea. 
                    William Herschel suggested the term "asteroid" (star-like), since their apparent sizes were smaller than those of stars.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 1878, the asteroid Hilda was discovered, which depending on the definition of the asteroid belt, is the first outside of it, being part of the Hilda asteroids.
                    Similarly, the asteroid Thule was discovered in 1888, which is even further away from the asteroid belt and closer to Jupiter.
                    Max Wolf pioneered the use of photography to discover asteroids since 1891.
                    He alone discovered 248 asteroids.
                    The first <a href="nea.html">near-Earth asteroid</a> to be discovered was Eros in 1898.
                    Achiles was the first <a href="trojan.html">trojan</a> of Jupiter to be discovered in 1906 by Wolf himself.
                    New asteroids were discovered at a much higher rate, requiring more complex provisional naming schemes before getting approved by the Minor Planet Center.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Eventually, many much smaller asteroids were being discovered with greater technology.
                    This has proven crucial in the cataloguing of near-Earth asteroids that are potentially hazardous and could strike <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.
                    DART, a mission by NASA, was the first to change the orbit of an asteroid, albeit a small one (Didymos's moon Dimorphos.)
                    A potential use of asteroids, particularly metal-rich ones, is asteroid mining.
                    The NASA mission Psyche is on its way to the asteroid of the same name to study its composition and formation.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Asteroids can be categorized in several ways.
                    According to color, albedo and spectral shape, asteroids can be classified into three broad classes - C (carbonaceous), S (stony/silicaceous), and X (other).
                    This is known as the Tholen classification, and is one of the most common spectral classifications.
                    These three also include several smaller ones, like the metallic M class (part of X-class).

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The asteroid belt is a region in the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a>, located roughly between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. 
                        It contains the highest concentration of asteroids and is roughly divided into three subbelts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The inner main belt asteroids are located within the Kirkwood gap that corresponds with 3:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter.
                        The largest members are Vesta, Fortuna, and Iris.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The intermediate main belt is located between the gaps corresponding to 3:1 and 5:2 resonances.
                        The largest members are Ceres, Pallas, and Eunomia.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The outer main belt is the region outside the 5:2 orbital resonance.
                        The largest members are Hygiea, Interamnia, and Europa.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        There are also a few groups within the belt that are resonant with Jupiter, notably the Alinda and Griqua groups.

                    Trojans are minor planets that orbit around the L4 and L5 Lagrange points of planets.
                    Trojan populations that are considered asteroids extend up to Jupiter.
                    The only planet not to have any known trojans is <a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a>.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Jupiter features the highest population of trojans.
                    They are named after characters from Greek mythology that have fought in the Trojan war, hence the name.
                    The largest L4 trojans have Greek names, while the L5 have Trojan names.
                    Exceptions are Hektor (a Trojan prince) and Patroclus (a Greek hero), which are part of their respective enemy camp, as they were named before the convention.
                    Hektor is the biggest of the trojan asteroids and is the 12th biggest overall.
                    The Lucy mission by NASA is expected to visit several Trojan asteroids, starting with Eurybates in 2027.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Other planets have much less trojans, since they do not have a gravitational field as strong as Jupiter, or are not close to the asteroid belt.

                        Near-Earth asteroids are a group of several families of asteroids tha orbit close to Earth.
                        Due to their proximity to Earth, they are of significant interest and are easier to detect than other small families near other planets.
                        There are four distinct groups.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Amor group are NEAs that orbit outside the orbits of Earth.
                        The largest of the Amors and largest NEA is Ganymed.

                        The Apollo group comprises NEAs that cross the Earth orbit, but have a semi-majoral axis greater than 1 AU.
                        They are the most numerous of the four groups.
                        Largest of the Apollos is the asteroid Sisyphus.

                    <p class="paragraph">

                        Several asteroids that have very close orbits to Earth are classified as potentially hazardous.
                        For that reason, NASA launched the mission DART to test asteroid deflection, successfully changing the orbits of Didymos's moon Dimorphos.
                        Other agencies are also considering similar missions.

                    The planet Vulcan's existence was debunked by Einstein's theory of relativity.

                    There are several groups of orbit-crossing asteroids apart from Earth crossers (Apollo and Aten groups).
                    Many asteroids are part of several of those groups, as they cross the orbits of multiple planets.
                    Mars crossers are asteroids that have orbits crossing those of Mars, but are not necessarily NEAs.
                    Every Venus and Mercury crosser is also considered a near-Earth asteroid.
                    A remarkable example is Phaeton, which has the smallest known perihelion of a named asteroid.
                    It is a member of the Apollo group of NEAs and a potentially-hazardous asteroid, as well as a Mercury, Venus, and Mars crosser.
                    2006 HY51 is another extreme example, which has the smallest known perihelion of a numbered minor planet, and falls into all the group Phaeton does, as well as being a Jupiter crosser.
