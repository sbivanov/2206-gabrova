                        2 Pallas is the third largest <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> in the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">asteroid belt</a> and the second to be discovered after <a href="ceres.html">Ceres</a>.
                        It is named after another name for Athens, the Greek goddess of war.
                        It has a high inclination of 34.8°, one of the highest in the main belt..
                        Just like the asteroids <a href="vesta.html">Vesta</a> and <a href="hygiea.html">Hygiea</a>, it is almost round in shape, but several large craters have deformed it.
                        So far, it hasn't been visited by a probe, mostly because of its high inclination..

                    In 1798 Franz Xaver von Zach and 24 more astronomers organized the United Astronomical Society (dubbed the "celestial police"), originally tasked with compiling more precise <a href="star.html">star</a> catalogues, but later began an organized search for a <a href="planet.html">planet</a> between Mars and <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>, due to the gap between them.
                    This was suggested by the recently formulated Titius-Bode law, according to which the distances of <a href="planet.html">planets</a> followed a progression.
                    It also led to the discovery of <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a> beyond the orbit of <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>.
                    Three years after their first congress, Ceres was discovered in this gap and was refered to as a planet.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pallas was discovered by Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers in 1802.
                    At the time, Olbers was trying to observe the recently discovered Ceres, when he coincidentally noticed another object not far from it.
                    This lead to the belief that Ceres and the new object were related.
                    The new object, named Pallas, was classified as a new planet, just like Ceres.
                    The mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who was also involved with the observation of these objects, calculated the orbit, concluding it was highly eccentric.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pallas is named after an epithet of the Greek goddess Athena.
                    In some versions of the myth, Athena accidentally killed the daughter of Triton Pallas, then adopted her name out of mourning.

                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="OrbitAndRotation">Orbit and rotation</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pallas is an intemediate main-belt asteroid with a semi-major axis of 2.77 AU.
                    It has an orbital period of 4.61 years and a rotational period of 7.8 hours.
                    The orbit is moderately elliptical with an eccentricity of 0.23.
                    Pallas is unique in that it is highly inclined at 34.93°.
                    This makes it hard to reach by a spacecraft.
                    Pallas is also in a near 1:1 resonance with Ceres.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pallas is part of a collisional family of highly eccentric asteroids.
                    Other members are much smaller and are likely ejecta from impacts.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pallas has a mean diameter of 512 km, making it the third largest asteroid after Ceres and the slightly larger Vesta.
                    Similar to Vesta and Hygiea, it is roughly rounded, but imperfect from not being in hydrostatic equilibrium.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pallas is a B-type asteroid - a bright carbonaceous type, characterized by low water and iron, olivine and pyroxene silicates and carbonaceous material.
                    It is comparable to C chondrites, in particular the CR chondrites (Renazzo family of meteorites).
                    Its density is around 2.8 g/cm^3, suggesting mostly rocky composition, but less than rocky planets.
                    The spectral type excludes much ie, so the interior might be more porous instead.
                    Pallas is possibly partially differentiated, since it is similar to Vesta in size, both being protoplanetary remnants.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    From <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> observations, several craters were identified.
                    34 are larger than 40 km in diameter.
                    Apart from asteroids, one bright spot has been discovered on the southern hemisphere.
                    It is likely similar to the bright spots on Ceres.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pallas has not been visited by any spacecraft.
                    A flyby was suggested during the Dawn mission, but there was not enough fuel for the probe.
                    There was also a proposed secondary payload satellite to be boarded on the Psyche mission while on its way to <a href="psyche.html">16 Psyche</a>, but was later dropped.
