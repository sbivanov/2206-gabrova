                        The universe is all of space and time, and their contents.
                        It comprises all forms of matter and energy, and the structures they form.
                        Cosmology, the study of the universe, establishes that space and time emerged together at the Big Bang 13.787±0.020 billion years ago and that the universe has been expanding ever since.
                        The total size of the universe is unknown, but a portion of it approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter can be observed with current technology.
