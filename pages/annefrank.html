                    Annefrank is named after Anne Frank, a victim of the Holocaust, known for her diary that documented her everyday life during World War II.
                    The name was proposed on the fiftieth anniversary of the end of WWII.

                    Annefrank is located in the inner asteroid belt.
                    The semi-major axis is 2.21 AU, the perihelion is 2.07 AU, and the aphelion is 2.35 AU.
                    It takes Annefrank 3.29 years to complete one orbit.
                    The eccentricity is 0.06 and the inclination is 4.25°.
                    The rotational period is around 15.12 hours.

                    Annefrank, like other Flora family asteroids, is part of the S spectral type, consisting of silicates.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 2002 Stardust flew by Annefrank at a range of about 3,078 km.
                    During the encounter, the spacecraft’s dust collectors collected samples while its camera returned 72 images.
                    This encounter was used as an engineering test of the spacecraft.
                    Stardust then continued on its way to comet 81P/Wild.
