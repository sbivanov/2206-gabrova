                        704 Interamnia is an outer <a href="asteroid-belt.html">main belt</a> <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a>.
                        It was discovered in 1910.
                        Interamnia is one of the largest asteroids, having a mean diameter greater than 300 km.

                    Interamnia is an asteroid in the outer asteroid belt.
                    The semi-major axis is 3.06 AU, the perihelion is 2.58 AU, and the aphelion is 3.53 AU.
                    It takes Interamnia 5.34 years to complete one orbit.
                    The eccentricity is 0.155 and the inclination is 17.31°.
                    The rotational period of Interamnia is 8.71 hours.

                    Despite being the fifth largest asteroid, Interamnia hasn't been well-studied, in part due to it being relatively distant.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Interamnia has triaxial dimensions of 362 × 348 × 310 km and a mean 332 km diameter.
                    This makes it the fifth largest asteroid.
                    Its shape is similar to that of <a href="vesta.html">Vesta</a>, close to an ellipsoid.

                    Interamnia is an F-type asteroid, consisting of carbonaceous material, but with less hydrated silicate minerals.
                    F-type asteroids are related to the C and B types.

                    The surface of Interamnia has been resolved by Earth-based telescopes like the Very Large Telescope.
                    However, no large impact basins have been found.
