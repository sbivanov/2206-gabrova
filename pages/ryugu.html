                        162173 Ryugu is a sub-kilometer <a href="nea.html">near-Earth</a> and potentially hazardous asteroid, part of the Apollo group.
                        It was discovered in 1999.
                        The <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> is a rubber pile of approximately 900 meters in diameter.
                        Its parent body likely formed in the outer solar system and was altered by water, then broken apart and reassembled into its current form
                        It is a primitive, carbon-rich asteroid with a highly porous, rubble-pile structure
                        Ryugu was the target of the Hayabusa2 sample return mission, second to Hayabusa, which collected material from <a href="itokawa.html">Itokawa</a>, another NEA.
                        The returned samples contain hydrated minerals and a variety of organic compounds, including some amino acids and nucleobases.

                    Ryugu was discovered in May 1999 at Socorro, New Mexico, part of the LINEAR survey.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Ryugu is named after Ryūgū-jō, a magical underwater palace in a Japanese folktale.
                    According to the story, a fisherman travels to the palace on the back of a turtle and returns with a treasure box given to him by the sea mistress.
                    This name was chosen for its resemblance to the Hayabusa2 mission, which was sent to retrieve a sample capsule, similar to the treasure box.

                    Ryugu is a near-Earth asteroid, part of the Apollo group.
                    The semi-major axis is 1.190 AU, the perihelion is 0.963 AU, and the aphelion is 1.416 AU.
                    Ryugu completes one orbit every 1.3 years.
                    The eccentricity is 0.190 and the inclination is 5.884°.
                    The rotational period is 7.63 hours.

                    Ryugu is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid.
                    The Earth minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) is 0.0006 AU, or 0.23 lunar distances.
                    There is no immediate risk from a collision with Ryugu, though it is one of the closest approaching asteroids to <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.

                        Ryugu has dimensions of 1004 × 876 m and a mean 896 km diameter.
                        The shape of Ryugu is similar to a spinning top with an equatorial ridge, all points approximately equally distanced from the center.
                        This makes Ryugu unusually rounded.

                        Ryugu is a C-type asteroid, particularly a Cb SMASS type, consisting of dark, carbon-rich rocks.
                        It is a rubble pile with high porosity.
                        The origin of Ryugu is thought to be from a <a href="asteroid-belt.html">main belt</a> asteroid collision, either Eulalia or Polana.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        According to sample analysis results, the parent body formed 2.5-3 million years ago in the outer <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a>.
                        Then, over the course of the next several years, rocks in the parent body reacted with water and became hydrous.
                        Thanks to the improved design of the Hayabusa2 capsule, water and volatiles were able to be preserved, something that the Hayabusa mission was unable to do.
                        Water in the samples accounts for around 7%.
                        Crystals that were likely formed in liquid water have also been reported, likely during the time of the parent body's existence.
                        Most importantly, complex organic molecules like amino acids, uracil and vitamin B3 have been detected.

                        Ryugu has an equatorial ridge - Ryujin Dorsum.
                        It is a result from the initial fast rotation of Ryugu that has displaced much of the rubble along the equator.
                        Several craters have also been identified.
                        As it is typical for rubble piles, there are many large bolders, some of which have been given names.

                        Ryugu was visited by the follow-up mission of Hayabusa, Hayabusa2.
                        The previous target, Itokawa, did not show much apart from rocks, mostly due to the early design of the spacecraft.
                        The samples returned with an improved capsule contained not just silicate rocks, but also water ice, simple organics, and most importantly complex organic compounds like uracil and vitamin B3.
                        The spacecraft's mission has been extended, now called Hayabusa2#.
                        It is on its way to two more asteroids - <a href="torifune.html">Torifune</a> and 1998 KY26.
