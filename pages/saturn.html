                    Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth, time and agriculture, father of Jupiter.
                    In Greek, the planet is named "Cronos" (Κρόνος) after the Greek analogue of Saturn, leader of the Titans.
                    The ancient Greek name of the planet was Phainon (Φαίνων).
                    The Hindu god representing the planet is Shani (शनि).
                    In Chinese the planet is known as "earth star" (土星) and the name is also used in other Sinosphere countries (countries culturally influenced by China).

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Saturn orbits the Sun with a semi-major axis of 9.58 AU, varying between 9.2 AU at perihelion and 9.96 AU at aphelion.
                    The planet completes one revolution around the Sun in approximately 10,759 <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> days (about 29.5 Earth years).
                    The orbits of Saturn have an eccentricity of 0.056 and an inclination of 2.48° relative to the ecliptic.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Saturn’s rotation is not uniform across its surface due to differential rotation.
                    At the equator and poles, the rotation period is about 10 hours and 14 minutes, while at other latitudes, it lengthens to 10 hours and 38 minutes.
                    The internal rotation period, derived from magnetic field measurements, is approximately 10 hours and 39 minutes.
                    Saturn has an axial tilt of 26.73°.

                    Saturn is an oblate spheroid with a mean diameter of about 116,464 km, or nine and a half times that of Earth, making it the second largest planet after Jupiter.
                    Its rapid rotation causes a pronounced flattening at the poles at 9.8%, the most of any planet in the Solar System.

                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="InternalStructure">Internal structure</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Saturn’s internal structure closely resembles that of Jupiter.
                    The core consists of silicate rock and ice, surrounded by a layer of metallic hydrogen, with liquid helium and hydrogen further out, and a gaseous outer atmosphere.
                    The extreme pressures and temperatures deep within Saturn may allow for the formation of diamond rain, as carbon crystallizes in the planet’s interior.
                    This process, while not directly observed, is supported by theoretical models.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The outer atmosphere is composed of 96.35% hydrogen and 3.25% helium.
                        Trace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, and other hydrocarbons have also been detected.
                        Saturn’s atmospheric features, such as bands and storms, are less pronounced than those on Jupiter, but the atmoosphere is still dynamic.
                        Cloud layers vary by latitude: the uppermost clouds are made of ammonia ice, while deeper layers contain water ice and ammonium hydrosulfide.
                        At pressures of 10–20 bar, clouds of water and ammonia droplets in aqueous solution form.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Storms on Saturn are typically short-lived, example beint a so-called “Great White Spot”.
                        Persistent vortices are found at both poles, including the famous hexagonal storm at the north pole.
                        A likely explanation is that it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere.
                        Polygonal shapes have been replicated in laboratory settings through differential rotation of fluids.
                        The south pole vortex is notably warmer, reaching temperatures of -122°C, compared to the planet’s average of -185°C.

                        Saturn’s dipole magnetosphere is the second-largest in the Solar System, extending over a million kilometers into space.
                        Its strength at the equator is 0.2 gauss, twenty times weaker than that of Jupiter and slightly weaker than that of Earth.
                        It is generated by the planet’s metallic hydrogen layer and rapid rotation.
                        The magnetosphere traps charged particles and interacts with the solar wind, creating auroras at the poles.
                        It also influences the environments of its moons.

                        The Saturnian rings are the most prominent and most extensive of all the planets in the Solar System.
                        They were first seen by Galileo Galilei in 1610, though he didn’t recognize them as rings, and later identified by Cristiaan Huygens.
                        The rings are composed predominantly of small water ice, tholin impurities and amorphous carbon particles.
                        They are likely around 10–100 million years old, possibly formed from a shattered moon, refered to as Chrysalis.
                        Saturn's main rings are only about 5-30 meters thick, but span up to 140,180 km in diameter

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        They are a complex system with thousands of ringlets, divided into main groups.
                        The main rings are D, C, B, A, and F.
                        B and A are the brightest and densest rings, separated by the 4,800 km Cassini Division.
                        F is also separated by the Roche gap, and is thinner
                        Other minor outer rings  and ring arcs are named after satellites orbiting them, except the G Ring and the Enceladus-formed E ring.
                        There is also a large, but less prominent torus around <a href="phoebe.html">Phoebe</a>, the largest irregular satellite of Saturn.

                    24 are regular satellites that have a relatively stable, circular orbit close to the planet. 
                    They were named after Titans, Giants, and other characters from Greek mythology. 
                    The biggest moon is Titan, a satellite bigger than the planet Mercury.

                    There are 17 other regular moons of Saturn - their orbits are nearly circular and have low inclinations.
                    The innermost moon (provisional name S/2009 S 1) is the smallest known Saturnian satellite and orbits near the B ring.
                    The next eight moons - Pan, Daphnis, Atlas, Prometheus, Pandora, Epimetheus, Janus, and Aegaon are all within the orbit of Mimas.
                    All but Atlas, Pandora, and Aegaon are shepherd moons, even though Atlas has an equatorial ridge.
                    Between the orbits of Mimas and Enceladus orbit three more satellites - Methone, Anthe, and Pallene.
                    The next two are trojans of Tethys - Telesto and Calypso, after which are the trojans of Dione - Helene and Polydeuces.
                    The last one is Hyperion, outside the orbit of Titan.
                    It is the largest of the non-round moons and is notable for its chaotic orbit and rotation and porous structure.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The remaining 250 are irregular and are split into Norse, Inuit, and Gallic groups. 
                    They are named after deities from the mythologies of each group's name.
                    The Inuit group (36 satellites) and the Gallic group (17 satellites) have prograde orbits, while the Norse group (197 satellites) have retrograde orbits.
                    The most massive irregularly-shaped satellite - Phoebe - is actually part of the Norse group, while it is named after a Greek Titaness. 
                    Siarnaq, Albiorix, and Paaliq are the next largest outer moons.

                    Saturn is one of the planets known since ancient times.
                    Galileo was the first to look through a telescope at the planet.
                    He was unable to resolve Saturn's rings, thinking they were two moons.
                    Cristiaan Huygens used a telescope with greater magnification.
                    He was the first to distinguish the ring system of Saturn and discovered the biggest moon - Titan.
                    Giovanni Domenico Cassini discovered four more moons - Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione.
                    William Herschel discovered the last two round moons - Mimas and Enceladus.
                    The first irregularly shaped satellite to be discovered was Hyperion and the first irregularly orbiting was Phoebe.

                        NASA's first mission to Saturn was Pioneer 11, which made the a flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within 20,000 km of the planet.
                        Images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons, at a resolution too low to discern any surface detail.
                        The spacecraft also studied the planet's rings, revealing the thin F-ring.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Voyager 1 probe managed to send back the first high-resolution images of the planet, its rings and satellites.
                        Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time.
                        Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan, studying the atmosphere of the moon.
                        The thickness of the atmosphere prevented surface details to be revealed.
                        A year later Voyager 2 passed the Saturn system, collecting further information about the planet.
                        Both missions discovered new satellites around Saturn.

                        ESA joined NASA to launch the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft.
                        Cassini completed two flybys around Titan before releasing the Huygens lander.
                        Discoveries during the mission were evidences of liquid water beneath the Enceladus surface and geysers, hydrocarbon lakes on Titan, and new satellites of Saturn.
                        The mission ended with its deliberate destruction within the atmosphere of Saturn in a similar manner to Jupiter's Galileo.

                        Proposed missions include a Saturn entry probe, Dragonfly, which is a probe that will explore Titan, and a few candidates for a mission to search for life on Enceladus.
