                        Saturn is the sixth from the Sun and second largest of the eight <a href="planet.html">planets</a> in the Solar System.

                        Of all the planets in the Solar System, Saturn is the most flattened at the poles, caused by rotation.
                        The atmosphere is less dynamic than that of Jupiter and has less features.
                        Such a feature is the hexagonal cloud at Saturn's north pole. 
                        Saturn is known for it's prominent rings composed of ice, rock and dust. 
                        There are 83 known <a href="natural-satellite.html">satellites</a> known to orbit the planet, 53 of them are named. 
                        The biggest of those moons is Titan, which is bigger than Mercury.
                        Other notable satellites are Rhea, Iapetus, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus and Mimas.
                        Within the rings are also numerous tiny moonlets.

                    Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth, time and agriculture, father of Jupiter.
                    In Greek, the planet is named "Cronos" (Κρόνος) after the Greek analogue of Saturn.
                    The ancient Greek name was Phainon (Φαίνων).
                    The Hindu god representing the planet is Shani (शनि).
                    In Chinese the planet is known as "earth star" (土星) and the name is also used in other Sinosphere countries (countries culturally influenced by China).

                    The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957 AU
                    It takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days to finish one revolution around the Sun.

                    The rotation period of Saturn is different all across the surface.
                    Around the equator and the poles, Saturn has a rotation period of 10h 14m 00s.
                    Across the other latitudes, the period is 10h 38m 25.4s.
                    The internal rotation period is around 10h 39m 22.4s.
                    Saturn has an axial tilt of 26.73°.

                    The interior contains liquid hydrogen and the outer atmosphere is gaseous.
                    It is suggested that diamond rains occur in the interior of giants, including Saturn.

                        Upper cloud layers feature ammonia ice clouds, while lower layers contain water ice and ammonium hydrosulfide ice clouds.
                        At the lowest layers, water and ammonia droplets in aqueous solution form at 10 - 20 bar.
                        Storms on Saturn are short-lived, an example is a so-called "Great White Spot".
                        Vortexes persist at the poles.
                        The one at the north pole is hexagonally-shaped and the south pole reaches -122 °C, far warmer than the average -185 °C.
