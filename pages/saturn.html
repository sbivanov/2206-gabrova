                        Of all the planets in the Solar System, Saturn is the most flattened at the poles, caused by rotation.
                        The atmosphere is less dynamic than that of Jupiter and has less features.
                        Such a feature is the hexagonal cloud at Saturn's north pole. 
                        Saturn is known for it's prominent rings composed of ice, rock and dust. 
                        There are 274 known <a href="natural-satellite.html">satellites</a> known <a href="satellites-of-saturn.html">to orbit the planet</a>, 66 of them have received permanent designations, and 63 of them are named. 
                        The biggest of those moons is <a href="titan.html">Titan</a>, which is bigger than <a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a>.

                        Four missions visited the Saturn system, starting with the flybys of Pioneer 11 and the two Voyagers.
                        The latest mission was Cassini-Huygens, which orbited around the planet for several years before its deliberate destruction within the atmosphere of Saturn.

                    Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth, time and agriculture, father of Jupiter.
                    In Greek, the planet is named "Cronos" (Κρόνος) after the Greek analogue of Saturn.
                    The ancient Greek name was Phainon (Φαίνων).
                    The Hindu god representing the planet is Shani (शनि).
                    In Chinese the planet is known as "earth star" (土星) and the name is also used in other Sinosphere countries (countries culturally influenced by China).

                    The average distance from the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a> is 9 AU.
                    The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957 AU
                    It takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days to finish one revolution around the Sun.

                    The rotation period of Saturn is different all across the surface.
                    Around the equator and the poles, Saturn has a rotation period of 10h 14m 00s.
                    Across the other latitudes, the period is 10h 38m 25.4s.
                    The internal rotation period is around 10h 39m 22.4s.
                    Saturn has an axial tilt of 26.73°.

                    Saturn is an oblate spheroid with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.

                    Saturn's structure is similar to <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> - the core is composed of silicates (rock), surrounded by metallic hydrogen.
                    The interior contains liquid hydrogen and the outer atmosphere is gaseous.
                    It is suggested that diamond rains occur in the interior of giants, including Saturn.

                        Saturnian features in the atmosphere like bands and storms are less aparent than those on Jupiter.
                        Clouds on Saturn consost of different elements based on  their latitude.
                        Upper cloud layers feature ammonia ice clouds, while lower layers contain water ice and ammonium hydrosulfide ice clouds.
                        At the lowest layers, water and ammonia droplets in aqueous solution form at 10 - 20 bar.
                        Storms on Saturn are short-lived, an example is a so-called "Great White Spot".
                        Vortexes persist at the poles.
                        The one at the north pole is hexagonally-shaped and the south pole reaches -122 °C, far warmer than the average -185 °C.

                        The main rings are D Ring, C Ring, B Ring, Cassini Division, A Ring and the thin F Ring.

                    Between the orbits of Mimas and Enceladus orbit three more satellites - Methone, Anthe, and Pallene.
                    The next two are trojans of Tethys - Telesto and Calypso, after which are the trojans of Dione - Helene and Polydeuces.
                    The last one is Hyperion, outside the orbit of Titan.
                    It is the largest of the non-round moons and is notable for its chaotic orbit and rotation and porous structure.

                    The remaining 250 are irregular and are split into Norse, Inuit, and Gallic groups. 
                    They are named after deities from the mythologies of each group's name.
                    The Inuit group (36 satellites) and the Gallic group (17 satellites) have prograde orbits, while the Norse group (197 satellites) have retrograde orbits.
                    The most massive irregularly-shaped satellite - Phoebe - is actually part of the Norse group, while it is named after a Greek Titaness. 
                    Siarnaq, Albiorix, and Paaliq are the next largest outer moons.

                    Saturn is one of the planets known in ancient times.
                    Galileo was the first to look through a telescope at the planet.
                    He was unable to resolve Saturn's rings, thinking they were two moons.
                    Cristiaan Huygens used a telescope with greater magnification.
                    He was the first to distinguish the ring system of Saturn and discovered the biggest moon - Titan.
                    Giovanni Domenico Cassini discovered four more moons - Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione.
                    William Herschel discovered the last two round moons - Mimas and Enceladus.
                    The first irregularly shaped satellite to be discovered was Hyperion and the first irregularly orbiting was Phoebe.

                        NASA's first mission to Saturn was Pioneer 11, which made the a flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within 20,000 km of the planet.
                        Images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons, at a resolution too low to discern any surface detail.
                        The spacecraft also studied the planet's rings, revealing the thin F-ring.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Voyager 1 probe managed to send back the first high-resolution images of the planet, its rings and satellites.
                        Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time.
                        Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan, studying the atmosphere of the moon.
                        The thickness of the atmosphere prevented surface details to be revealed.
                        A year later Voyager 2 passed the Saturn system, collecting further information about the planet.
                        Both missions discovered new satellites around Saturn.

                        ESA joined NASA to launch the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft.
                        Cassini completed two flybys around Titan before releasing the Huygens lander.
                        Discoveries during the mission were evidences of liquid water beneath the Enceladus surface and geysers, hydrocarbon lakes on Titan, and new satellites of Saturn.
                        The mission ended with its deliberate destruction within the atmosphere of Saturn in a similar manner to Jupiter's Galileo.

                        Proposed missions include a Saturn entry probe, Dragonfly, which is a probe that will explore Titan, and a few candidates for a mission to search for life on Enceladus.
