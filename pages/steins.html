                        2867 Šteins is an inner <a href="asteroid-belt.html">main belt</a> <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a>.
                        It was discovered in 1969 and is part of the rare E-type of asteroids.
                        Šteins was a secondary target of the Rosetta mission that later visited <a href="comet.html">comet</a> 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

                    Šteins is a background asteroid in the inner asteroid belt.
                    The semi-major axis is 2.36 AU, the perihelion is 2.02 AU, and the aphelion is 2.71 AU.
                    It takes Šteins 3.63 years to complete one orbit.
                    The eccentricity is 0.15 and the inclination is 9.94°.
                    The rotational period of Šteins is 6.05 hours.

                    Šteins has triaxial dimensions of 6.83 × 5.70 × 4.42 km and a mean 4.92 diameter.
                    The shape of Šteins has been compared to that of a faceted gem, in particular a diamond.

                    Šteins is an E-type asteroid, consisting of the Mg-rich orthopyroxene enstatite.
                    It's composition corresponds to Aubrites - enstatite achondrite meteorites found on <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.
                    In general, spectral data from Rosetta confirmed Šteins was composed mainly of iron-poor minerals such as enstatite, forsterite, and feldspar.

                    The surface of Šteins has several craters.
                    The largest named one is Diamong crater, 2.1 km in diameter.
                    Other craters larger than a kilometer are Zircon, Chrysoberyl, and Onyx.

                    Šteins was one of two secondary asteroid flyby targets for the Rosetta spacecraft by ESA, the other being asteroid <a href="lutetia.html">Lutetia</a>.
                    On 5 September 2008, it flew by 800 km at its closest and obtained several images before going to Lutetia and the main target, the periodical comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
