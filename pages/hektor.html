                    Hektor was discovered in 1907 by August Kopff at the Heidelberg Observatory.
                    It is the first trojan asteroid to be discovered.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Hektor is named after Hector, the Trojan prince from Greek mythology, who lead Troy against the Greek in the Trojan War and is ultimately defeated by Achilles.
                    Any subsequent Jupiter trojan that was discovered was named after a hero from the Trojan War.
                    After two groups, or "camps", were discovered (corresponding to their relative to Jupiter position), Greek hero names were used for Greek camp asteroids and Trojan hero names were used for Trojan camp asteroids.
                    However, Hektor is one of two Jupiter trojans that do not correspond to this newer convention, the other being Patroclus in the Trojan camp.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Hektor is a Jupiter trojan in the Greek camp, around the L4 point.
                    The semi-major axis is 5.257 AU, the perihelion is 5.132 AU, and the aphelion is 5.382 AU.
                    It takes Hektor 12.05 years to complete one orbit.
                    The eccentricity is 0.0238 and the inclination is 18.166°.
                    The rotational period of Hektor is 6.92 hours.

                    Hektor is part of a small family that consists of 12 known members.
                    It makes up 99.6% of the Hektor family's mass.

                    Hektor has triaxial dimensions of 370 × 195 × 195 km and a mean 250 km diameter.
                    Its shape is significantly elongated and is possibly a contact binary.
                    If that is the case, estimates give it a 256 km diameter.

                    Hektor is a D-type asteroid, consisting of organic-rich silicates, carbon and anhydrous silicates.
                    D asteroids are darker and redder than others and are closer to distant minor planets in composition.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Hektor has one moon, Skamandrios.
                    It was discovered in 2006 and its name (alternate spelling of Skamandrius) is shared with three Trojan characters - the son of Hector, also known as Astyanax, Hector's brother Helenus, and a warrior slain by Menelaus.
                    The former two, although related to Hector, are better known by another name and have their own asteroids (1871 Astyanax and 1872 Helenos respectively).
                    Skamandrios measures at around 10-15 km in diameter.
