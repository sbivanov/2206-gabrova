                    The asteroid belt is a region in the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a>, located roughly between the orbits of the <a href="planet.html">planets</a> <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> and <a href="mars.html">Mars</a>. 
                    It contains many irregularly shaped bodies called <a href="asteroid.html">asteroids</a> or minor planets. 
                    This asteroid belt is also known as the main asteroid belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations such as <a href="nea.html">near-Earth asteroids</a> and <a href="trojan.html">trojan</a> asteroids.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 1596, Johannes Kepler assumed that there must be a planet between Mars and Jupiter, due to the gap between the planets. 
                    He stated that it was "God's design" for the distance between planets to follow a mathematical progression.
                    Based on this observation, Johann Daniel Titius and later Johann Elert Bode in 1772 derived the Titius-Bode law, which was an attempt to predict the location of new planets.
                    It yielded a result in 1781, when William Herschel discovered <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a> beyond the orbit of <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>.
                    Later, Franz Xaver von Zach and 24 more astronomers organized the United Astronomical Society (dubbed the "celestial police"), originally tasked with compiling more precise <a href="star.html">star</a> catalogues, but later began an organized search for the mysterious planet.
                    Three years after their first congress, in 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi discovered <a href="ceres.html">Ceres</a> at the observatory in Palermo.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    After other members of the "celestial police" discovered other "planets" like <a href="pallas.html">Pallas</a>, <a href="juno-asteroid.html">Juno</a>, and <a href="vesta.html">Vesta</a>, they started to suspect that they were not planets, but a new class of objects.
                    Herschel suggested the term "asteroid" (star-like), since their apparent sizes were smaller than those of stars.
                    Titius-Bode law was later disproven by the discovery of <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Today, there are over half a million discovered asteroids, many of which are located in the belt.

                    The inner main belt asteroids are located within the Kirkwood gap that corresponds with 3:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter.
                    The largest members are Vesta, <a href="fortuna.html">Fortuna</a>, and Iris.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The intermediate main belt is located between the gaps corresponding to 3:1 and 5:2 resonances.
                    The largest members are Ceres, Pallas, and <a href="eunomia.html">Eunomia</a>.

                    The outer main belt is the region outside the 5:2 orbital resonance.

                        The surface of the asteroid consists of ice and carbonates. 
                        Cryovolcanic activity shapes the surface of the dwarf planet, thanks to which many bright spots in craters and a single cryovolcanic mountain (Ahuna Mons) exist.

                        Vesta is the second biggest asteroid in the asteroid belt. 
                        It is named after the Roman goddess of the home and family. 
                        Vesta's shape is close to an oblate spheroid, but is not a dwarf planet, because it is not in hydrostatic equilibrium.
                        It is believed that Vesta used to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and still has differentiated internal structure, but lost its round shape.
                        A recognisable feature is the Rheasilvia crater, which has left a mountain that is almost as tall as Olympus Mons on Mars.

                        Just like Vesta, it is almost round.

                        The first spacecraft to make close flybys of the asteroids in the asteroid belt was the Galileo mission while on its way to Jupiter, which encountered the asteroids Gaspra and Ida in 1991 and 1993 respectively.
                        It was found that Ida has a small moon orbiting it, named Dactyl.
                        Other asteroids that were visited by spacecraft on their way to other objects include Annefrank by Stardust and Lutetia and Šteins by Rosetta. 
                        NEAR Shoemaker, launched in 1996, was also the first dedicated asteroid mission, which first passed by the main-belt Mathilde, after which it entered orbit around near-Earth asteroid Eros.
                        Lucy, a NASA mission that will be the first to visit the Jupiter trojans also encountered two main-belt asteroids.
                        The first, Dinkinesh, was interesting in that it had a satellite, named Selam, which was a contact binary.
                        The second asteroid, Donaldjohanson, was itself another contact binary.

                        It will enter orbit around <a href="psyche.html">the asteroid of the same name</a> for 20 months.
                        The reason that Psyche was selected for the mission is due to its metallic composition.
                        While Lutetia, a previously visited asteroid, is an M-type spectra, data suggests that it is much richer in metals.
                        Psyche will see if Psyche is an exposed metal core of a protoplanet, or a stone with regolith consisting of metal-rich compounds.

                        Another upcoming mission is MBR Explorer, planned by the UAE Space Agency.
                        It will first fly by six asteroids - Westerwald, Chimaera, Rockox, Ghaf, Ousha, and Moza.
                        Then, it will orbit a seventh, Justitia, and lastly land, examining the prospects of asteroid mining.
                        Justitia is an unusually red asteroid, suggesting it is tholin-rich and has likely migrated from the outer Solar System.
