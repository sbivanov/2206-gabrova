                    Extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, are <a href="planet.html">planets</a> orbiting <a href="star.html">stars</a> different from the Sun. 
                    The first exoplanet was confirmed to exist in 1992. 
                    There are more than 5,000 known exoplanets.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Many methods are used for detecting exoplanets, from direct imaging to transit and radial detections.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The closest exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b, is located 4.2 light-years from <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> and orbits Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth.
                    The planet is a potentially habitable, orbiting Proxima in it's habitable zone.
                    Two other candidates may also orbit the star.
                </p>
                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Naming">Naming</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Exoplanet names are assigned based on the name of a star, with an additional letter at the end of the name. 
                    The first planet to be discovered in a system is assigned a letter "b", with every new planet getting assigned the following letter of the alphabet. 
                    If more than one planet are found at once, letters are assigned in order of the innermost to the outermost of the planets.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    For example, the star Kepler-186 has five known exoplanets - from Kepler-186 b (innermost) to Kepler-186 f (outermost).
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The IAU holds naming contests for planets and their hosts stars. 
                    The closest planet to Earth with a proper name is Ægir, 10.5 light-years from Earth.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Exoplanets are hard to detect directly, since they don't reflect as much light as the parent <a href="star.html">star</a> releases. 
                    Every directly imaged exoplanet is more massive than <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> and far from the host star.

                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="PulsarTiming">Pulsar timing</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Pulsars emit radio waves regularly. 
                    Once a planet orbiting a pulsar transits, it will cause slight anomalies in timing. 
                    The method is very precise and can detect planets smaller than <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>, but the rarity of pulsars and exoplanets orbiting them make this method highly unproductive.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The first exoplanets ever are Draugr, Poltergeist and Phobetor, which orbit the pulsar PSR B1257+12.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Planets will influence the position of a star, due to gravity. 
                    This leads to small changes in the position of a star. 
                    With astrometry - the precise measurement of positions and movements of stars can detect planets. 
                    It has also detected very few planets.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Gravitational fields of stars can magnify the light of distant background stars. 
                    Planets can cause anomalies in the detection of microlensing. 
                    This method is most sensitive to planets around 1-10 AU away from Sun-like stars.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The transit time of planets around multiple stars or planets with <a href="natural-satellite.html">moons</a> will vary. 
                    No planet has been detected with this method, but circumbinary planets are successfuly confirmed with transit duration variation.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    One such planet is Kepler-16b, which orbits two stars - Kepler-16 A and Kepler-16 B.

                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="TransitTimingVariation">Transit timing variation</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    When multiple exoplanets are present, each one slightly perturbs the others' orbits. 
                    Small variations in the times of transit for one planet can thus indicate the presence of another non-transiting planet.
                </p>
                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="RadialVelocity">Radial velocity</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Stars orbit around the center of the system. 
                    Due to the Doppler effect, variations in the star's radial velocity can be detected. 
                    This method can detect planets orbiting low-mass stars. 
                    It was the most productive method, until the transit method overtook it.
                </p>
                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="Transit">Transit</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Planets transiting in front of stars can change the observed brightness of the host star. 
                    This method detects planets with small orbits and has a high rate of false detections, but can determine more characteristics than other methods. 
                    The Kepler telescope used this method.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Exoplanets are yet to be studied for life. 
                    One metric for measuring habitability is the location of a planet. 
                    If a planet is orbiting in the habitable zone of it's host <a href="star.html">star</a>, water could exist in all three states. 
                    Another metric is the size of a planet - planets with sizes similar to Earth are more likely to be similar in other aspects.
