                    Extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, are <a href="planet.html">planets</a> orbiting <a href="star.html">stars</a> different from the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>. 
                    The first exoplanet was confirmed to exist in 1992. 
                    There are more than 6,000 known exoplanets.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Many methods are used for detecting exoplanets, from direct imaging to transit and radial detections.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The closest exoplanets, Proxima Centauri b and d, are located 4.2 light-years from <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> and orbit Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth.
                    Proxima b is a potentially habitable, orbiting Proxima in it's habitable zone.
                    One other candidate may also orbit the star.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        In the 16th century, Giordano Bruno, an early supporter of heliocentrism, proposed that fixed stars have planets of their own just like the Sun.
                        Issaac Newton also has mentioned this as a possibility in his book Principia.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        In 1992, two planets were discovered around the pulsar PSR B1257+12.
                        The two planets - Poltergeist and Phobetor - are the first known exoplanets.
                        A third planet was later discovered in 1994 - Draugr.
                        In 1995, another planet was discovered, this time around the star 51 Pegasi.
                        The planet Pegasi 51b, later named Dimidium, is the first to orbit around another main-sequence star.
                        In 2002, it was confirmed that there was a planet around Gamma Cephei A.
                        Tadmor, as it was named, was the first detected candidate that was later confirmed, originally reported in 1988.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        In 2009, NASA launched the Kepler Space Telescope.
                        It searched for nearby stars with possible planets using the transit method.
                        It has yielded more than 2000 confirmed exoplanets.
                        The successor to KST is TESS, which has over 7,000 candidates yet to be confirmed.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Exoplanet names are assigned based on the name of a star, with an additional letter at the end of the name. 
                    The first planet to be discovered in a system is assigned a letter "b", with every new planet getting assigned the following letter of the alphabet. 
                    If more than one planet are found at once, letters are assigned in order of the innermost to the outermost of the planets.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    For example, the star Kepler-186 has five known exoplanets - from Kepler-186 b (innermost) to Kepler-186 f (outermost).
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The IAU holds naming contests for planets and their hosts stars. 
                    The closest planet to Earth with a proper name is Ã†gir, around Epsilon Eridani, 10.5 light-years from Earth.

                    Since there are way more planets outside the Solar System, they are much more diverse than eight known around the Sun.
                    Apart from terrestrial, ice giants (<a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>-like) and gas giants (<a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>-like), there are also Super-Earths and Mini-Neptunes, which are 2 to 10 Earth masses and composed of similar material to their respective close analogue.
                    There are also Super-Jupiters, which are the biggest known planets.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Depending on their orbits, there are unique planets that break the Solar System model of terrestrial planets being closer to the Sun.
                    Hot Jupiters and Neptunes are two classes of planets that resemble their Solar System analogs in size, but orbit close to their star, heating their surfaces.
                    Depending on what they orbit, there are also circumbinary planets and circumtriple planets that orbit two and three stars respectively.
                    Examples of such exoplanets are Kepler-16 b (circumbinary) and Gliese 900 b.
                    Some planets orbit around stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, pulsars, <a href="black-hole.html">black holes</a>) or brown dwarfs instead.
                    Rogue planets are those that do not orbit any of these, instead they move through the interstellar medium.
                    An example of a rogue planet is OGLE-2016-BLG-1928.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Important exoplanets are those that orbit within the habitable zone of their stars.
                    If they are the size of Earth, then they are potentially habitable.

                        Planets transiting in front of stars can change the observed brightness of the host star. 
                        This method detects planets with small orbits and has a high rate of false detections, but can determine more characteristics than other methods. 
                        The Kepler telescope used this method.

                        Stars orbit around the center of the system. 
                        Due to the Doppler effect, variations in the star's radial velocity can be detected. 
                        This method can detect planets orbiting low-mass stars. 
                        It was the most productive method, until the transit method overtook it.

                        Gravitational fields of stars can magnify the light of distant background stars. 
                        Planets can cause anomalies in the detection of microlensing. 
                        This method is most sensitive to planets around 1-10 AU away from Sun-like stars.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Exoplanets are hard to detect directly, since they don't reflect as much light as the parent star releases. 
                        Every directly imaged exoplanet is more massive than Jupiter and far from the host star.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Pulsars emit radio waves regularly. 
                        Once a planet orbiting a pulsar transits, it will cause slight anomalies in timing. 
                        The method is very precise and can detect planets smaller than Earth, but the rarity of pulsars and exoplanets orbiting them make this method highly unproductive.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The first exoplanets to be confirmed - Draugr, Poltergeist, and Phobetor -were detected by pulsar timing, around PSR B1257+12.

                        Planets will influence the position of a star, due to gravity. 
                        This leads to small changes in the position of a star. 
                        With astrometry - the precise measurement of positions and movements of stars can detect planets. 
                        It has also detected very few planets.

                        When multiple exoplanets are present, each one slightly perturbs the others' orbits. 
                        Small variations in the times of transit for one planet can thus indicate the presence of another non-transiting planet.

                        The transit time of planets around multiple stars or planets with <a href="natural-satellite.html">moons</a> will vary. 
                        No planet has been detected with this method, but circumbinary planets are successfuly confirmed with transit duration variation.

                    Exoplanets are yet to be studied for life. 
                    One metric for measuring habitability is the location of a planet. 
                    If a planet is orbiting in the habitable zone of it's host star, water could exist in all three states. 
                    Another metric is the size of a planet - planets with sizes similar to Earth are more likely to be similar in other aspects.
