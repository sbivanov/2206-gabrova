                    Eunomia is an asteroid in the intermediate asteroid belt.
                    The semi-major axis is 2.644 AU, the perihelion is 2.15 AU, and the aphelion is 3.14 AU.
                    It takes Eunomia 4.30 years to complete one orbit.

                    Eunomia is an S-type asteroid, consisting of silicates and some nickel-iron.
                    Spectroscopic analysis has also shown the presence of calcium-rich pyroxenes and olivine.
                    The surface has regions with differing compositions.
                    This suggests that Eunomia's parent body was subject to internal heating.
