                        Centaurs are distant minor planets that orbit between the outer <a href="planet.html">planets</a> (<a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> to <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>).
                        Since they cross the orbits of the giant planets, they usually have unstable orbits.
                        Before they were centaurs, these bodies originated from the Kuiper Belt, before their orbits were pertrubed.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        They are named after the Greek mythological half man and half horse creatures, because they typically exhibit the characteristics of both <a href="asteroid.html">asteroids</a> and <a href="comet.html">comets</a>.
                        In fact, some centaurs appear to not only have comet-like dust comas, but are also considered comets.
                        No centaur has been observed from up close, but <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>'s moon <a href="phoebe.html">Phoebe</a>, visited by the Cassini probe, might be a captured centaur.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    There are several definitions on what makes a minor planet a centaur.
                    According to the Minor Planet Center, centaurs have a perihelion beyond the orbit of Jupiter (5.2 AU) and a semi-major axis less than that of Neptune (30.1 AU).
                    A similar definition is that of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which lists objects with semi-major axis between that of Jupiter and Neptune as centaurs.
                    Some astronomers consider centaurs to be all non-resonant distant minor planets that have a perihelion inside the orbit of Neptune, making <a href="tno.html">trans-Neptunian objects</a> like 2018 AG37 centaurs.
                    Such is the classification used by Johnston's archive "List of known Trans-Neptunian Objects".
                    In contrast, the Deep Ecliptic Survey defines centaurs using a dynamical classification scheme based on the simulated change in behavior of the present orbit when extended over 10 million years.
                    The DES defines centaurs as non-resonant objects whose osculating perihelia are less than the osculating semi-major axis of Neptune at any time during the simulation.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    For the purposes of consistency, the definition by JPL will be used in this article, unless noted.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 1920, an unusual object was discovered, later named Hidalgo.
                    It was originally considered an asteroid, since no significantly more distant objects have been discovered by then.
                    In 1977, another such object was discovered near its aphelion.
                    It exhibited some comet-like properties, apart from being similar to the asteroids.
                    This object was later named after the centaur Chiron and became the prototype for other such objects.
                    Hidalgo is since considered either a centaur or "unusual" (unclassified distant minor planet) because of its perihelion crossing the orbit of Jupiter.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    A strange object with orbital characteristics similar to centaurs and <a href="halley.html">Halley</a>-type comets is Damocles, discovered in 1991.
                    Similarly to Hidalgo, some definitions exclude it from the centaur category and instead consider it to be part of its own class of damocloids.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Centaurs have unstable, elliptical orbits that cross or come close to the orbits of the giant planets.
                        They originate from he Kuiper belt and get pertrubed by Neptune, thus becoming centaurs.
                        Afterwards, their orbits become dynamic, with lifetimes typically measured in millions of years before they are either ejected from the solar system, collide with a planet, or transition into short-period comets.
                        Saturn's moon Phoebe is possibly a former centaur and is a unique case where the object has been captured by Saturn.

                    <h3 class="paragraphheader" id="Size">Size</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The biggest known centaur is Chariklo at a diameter of approximately 242 km.
                        However, 2014 NW65 could be bigger, with some estimates putting it at 275 km, while others give a diameter of 213 km.
                        If the definitions by Johnston's archive and DES are used, there are some significantly larger objects like Xewioso (565 km) and 2018 AG37 (400-797 km).
                        Because of their small size (apart from the latter TNOs), none of the known centaurs are likely to be round and therefore a <a href="dwarf-planet.html">dwarf planet</a>.
                        No centaur has been visited and observed up close.
                        Data from Hubble Space Telescope, however, has shown brightening on the surface of Asbolus, indicating a likely fresh crater.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Centaurs are thought to be composed of a mixture of ice (water, methane, carbon monoxide) and dust, similar to comets.
                        Other components include rock, carbon, and organic materials, including tholins that give some centaurs a red color.
                        Some exhibit cometary activity, such as the development of a coma, when they approach the Sun.
                        Chiron and Echelus are classified both as comets and centaurs.

                        Two centaurs - Chariklo and Chiron - have shown the presence of ring systems.
