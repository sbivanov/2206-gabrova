                        Mercury is so close to the sun that it rotates in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance with the Sun.
                        This also means that one Mercurian day takes two revolutions around the Sun.
                        It has the smallest axial tilt of all planets in the Solar System at 0Â° 2'.

                        There are also evidence of some ice water at the poles.
                        Mercury has no natural satellites.

                    The planet was known since ancient times and had different names as a morning and an evening star.
                    The ancient Greeks had realised that the two are a single object.
                    It was named after Hermes, the swift-footed messenger god, for it's fast movement across the sky.
                    The Romans gave it the name "Mercurius", which is the name of Hermes' analogue in Roman mythology.

                    One Mercury solar day thus equates to two Mercury years.
                    In Earth days, one synodic day is almost 176 Earth days, which is three times the sidereal day and the orbital period is 88 days.
                    Mercury has a very low axial tilt of 1/30 degrees.

                    It has an equatorial radius of 2,440 km.
                    Two natural satellites in the Solar System, <a href="ganymede.html">Ganymede</a> and <a href="titan.html">Titan</a>, are larger than Mercury, but have a small mass.

                    Mercury is a terrestrial planet, consisting of 30% silicates and 70% metallic material.
                    The crust and the mantle are mostly silicates, while the core consists of iron sulfide outside, liquid iron in the middle and solid iron inside.
                    The high amount of iron makes Mercury the second densest planet after <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.

                        Mercury has a similar surface to that of the <a href="moon.html">Moon</a>, full of craters and plains (mare).
                        The largest crater is the 1550 km wide Caloris Basin, which is surrounded by a 2 km tall concentric ring.
                        The antipode of Caloris is a hilly terrain, likely created from the impact.
                        More recent crater feature ray systems.

                        At the poles, ice remains inside deep craters, where shadows keep them from melting.

                    Two missions have taken place and one is currently ongoing.
                    NASA's Mariner 10 was the first in 1974.
                    The mission objectives were to measure Mercury's environment, atmosphere, surface, and body characteristics.
                    It was the first mission to perform multiple planetary flybys.

                    MESSENGER was NASA's second mission in 2011.
                    Unlike Mariner 10, MESSENGER enterer Mercury's orbit.
                    The objectives were to explain Mercury's high density, geological history, nature of its magnetic field and structure of its core.

                    An ongoing mission between ESA and JAXA, called BepiColombo, was launched in 2018.
                    It is planned to get into Mercury orbit in 2025.
                    Two probes will be released to study the planet.
