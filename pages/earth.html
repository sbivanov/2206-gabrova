                    Like other planets in the Solar System, the oldest Earth material dates back to 4.5 billion years.
                    It is believed that Earth was formed by a protoplanetary disc collapsing.
                    Million years after that, a protoplanet called Theia collided with Earth and formed the Moon in the process.

                    Earth's surface gradually cooled and a solid crust formed. 
                    Ice was brought by comets and other object, which turned into oceans by the volcanic activity.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Between four and three and a half billion years ago the first life forms appeared.
                    Multiple theories exist on how life on Earth formed.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Spontaneous spawning is an ancient theory, first mentioned by Aristotle.
                    According to him, lower life forms formed from decaying organic matter.
                    In 1668 Francesco Redi conducted an experiment, in which meat was left rotting, to see if maggots appeared, but none did, disproving the theory.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Another ancient theory dates back to Anaxagoras in the 5th century BC - Panspermia.
                    It states that life exist throughout the universe and was brought to Earth by comets and asteroids.
                    This theory does not mention how life formed, only the method it was carried to Earth.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 19th century several people proposed that life might have formed from inorganic compounds.
                    In 1924 Alexander Oparin and later in 1929 J. B. S. Haldane stated that the molecules constituting cells slowly self-organised from a so-called "primordial soup".
                    Chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey successfuly simulated such conditions in 1952.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Over the course of more than three billion years, life has evolved slowly, changing Earth's environment. 
                    Photosynthesizing life enriched the atmosphere with oxygen and multicellular organisms appeared. 
                    After the emergence of vertebrate organisms, fish quickly developed, and from them - the first amphibians evolved, which were the first to leave the oceans. 
                    There were many mass extinction, the most recent occuring 66 million years ago, when a massive asteroid wiped out most non-avian life and especially dinosaurs. 
                    Smaller mammals survived the impact and among those, apes gained abilities like upright standing and tool bearing. 
                    They are members of the class Homo, which evolved into the modern-day humans.

                        The athmosphere of Earth is mostly made up of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. 
                        The remaining 1% consisting of other gases like water vapors, argon, carbon dioxide, neon, helium, methane and krypton.
                        Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases like methane capture part of the energy from the Sun and warm the Earth. 
                        Those gases increase every year due to human activity, resulting in rising average temperatures.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The atmosphere is divided into five parts. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The lowest 6-20 km are the troposphere.
                        It contains 3/4 of the total mass of the atmosphere. 
                        This layer is where the air is flowing due to the rotational turbulence of Earth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The stratosphere is the next layer, lying at 20-50 km. 
                        Hotter air is concentrated at higher altitudes and colder at lower ones.
                        Commercial aircrafts fly at the lower end of the stratosphere to avoid turbulence in the troposphere.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The mesosphere is located between 50-85 km. 
                        Temperatures decrease as altitudes increase.
                        This is where the lowest temperature in the atmosphere is.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The thermosphere reaches altitudes of 690 km.
                        As a part of the broader ionosphere, this layer is where air starts to get photoionised.
                        Temperatures can get significantly lower than 0°C or as high as 2,500°C.
                        The International Space Station orbits the Earth within the thermosphere.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The exosphere is the last layer, which gradually thins out into the Earth's magnetosphere.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="Hydrosphere">Hydrosphere</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The hydrosphere consists of all the water on Earth.
                    Most of it is in a liquid state and is a part of the world ocean, but also rivers and lakes.
                    Oceans and some lakes contain saline water, whereas rivers and other lakes are fresh water.
                    Ice water is concentrated at the poles and high altitudes, forming glaciers.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The abundant water changes states and moves, a process known as the water cycle.
                    Water can evaporate, going into the atmosphere and forming clouds.
                    Vapors condenses and precipitates usually in the form of rain, snow, or hail.
                    The water can get into rivers, lakes, oceans, or into groundwater reservoirs, completing the cycle.

                        The Moon is the only <a href="natural-satellite.html">natural satellite</a> orbiting Earth. 
                        It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and is the largest relative to it's parent planet. 
                        The Moon has no magnetic field, a hydrosphere, or a significant athmosphere.
                        The lunar gravitational attraction causes tides on Earth.

                        It is also the only natural astronomic body other than Earth that has been visited by people during NASA's Apollo mission. 
                        The Artemis mission is a follow-up to Apollo, with the uncrewed Artemis 1 already ongoing.
