                        Earth contains liquid water on 71% of the surface and the remaining 29% is land.
                        The crust is made up of several tectonic plates that create the various features on Earth's surface - mountain ranges, volcanoes, trenches, and cause earthquakes.
                        The liquid outer core of the Earth is responsible for the magnetosphere, which protects from solar and cosmic radiation.

                        The 1950s marked the beginning of space exploration.
                        The first object to enter Earth orbit was Sputnik 1, which started the Space Race between the USSR and the USA.
                        Since then, the two superpowers were competing in the field of space technology for the purposes of national security and defense, but later went on to explore Earth and space for scientific reasons.
                        Today, many artificial satellites orbit Earth, including space stations like the International Space Station, a collaborative project between multiple countries.

                    Like other planets in the Solar System, the oldest Earth material dates back to 4.5 billion years.
                    It is believed that Earth was formed by a protoplanetary disc collapsing.
                    Million years after that, a protoplanet called Theia collided with Earth and formed the Moon in the process.

                    Earth's surface gradually cooled and a solid crust formed.

                    Between four and three and a half billion years ago the first life forms appeared.
                    Multiple theories exist on how life on Earth formed.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Spontaneous spawning is an ancient theory, first mentioned by Aristotle.
                    According to him, lower life forms formed from decaying organic matter.
                    In 1668 Francesco Redi conducted an experiment, in which meat was left rotting, to see if maggots appeared, but none did, disproving the theory.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Another ancient theory dates back to Anaxagoras in the 5th century BC - Panspermia.
                    It states that life exist throughout the universe and was brought to Earth by <a href="comet.html">comets</a> and <a href="asteroid.html">asteroids</a>.
                    This theory does not mention how life formed, only the method it was carried to Earth.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 19th century several people proposed that life might have formed from inorganic compounds.
                    In 1924 Alexander Oparin and later in 1929 J. B. S. Haldane stated that the molecules constituting cells slowly self-organised from a so-called "primordial soup".
                    Chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey successfuly simulated such conditions in 1952.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Over the course of more than three billion years, life has evolved slowly, changing Earth's environment. 
                    Photosynthesizing life enriched the atmosphere with oxygen and multicellular organisms appeared. 
                    After the emergence of vertebrate organisms, fish quickly developed, and from them - the first amphibians evolved, which were the first to leave the oceans. 
                    There were many mass extinction, the most recent occuring 66 million years ago, when a massive asteroid wiped out most non-avian life and especially dinosaurs. 
                    Smaller mammals survived the impact and among those, apes gained abilities like upright standing and tool bearing. 
                    They are members of the class Homo, which evolved into the modern-day humans.

                        The axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.44°.
                        Summer occurs after the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere or the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere face the Sun.
                        Winter occurs at the same time at the opposite hemisphere.
                        These two positions of the Earth are calles solstices.
                        Equinoxes occur twice a year, when the Equator faces the Sun.
                        The axial tilt also creates two other circles - the Arctic and Antarctic circles.

                    October 4 1957 marked the start of space exploration, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the world’s first artificial satellite.
                    The metal sphere orbited Earth every 96 minutes, transmitting simple radio signals.
                    Sputnik’s success surprised the the United States, forcing them to accelerate their own space program and starting the Space Race between the USSR and the USA.
                    Sputnik 2 was the next step, this time carrying the first living being into orbit: a stray dog named Laika.
                    Though Laika did not survive the mission, her flight proved that a living organism could endure spaceflight.
                    The United States responded with its first satellite, Explorer 1, launched the next year and discovered the Van Allen radiation belt surrounding Earth.
                    As part of the second Korabl-Sputnik mission, two more dogs - Belka and Strelka, were the first to return alive from orbit in outer space.

                    In 1961, after three more missions with dogs on board, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space and to orbit Earth aboard Vostok 1.
                    The spaceflight consisted of a single orbit after which Gagarin would descend with a parachute landing in Saratov Oblast, Russian SSR.
                    Five more Vostok spacecrafts were sent in orbit, each with one crewman.
                    In 1962, as part of Project Mercury, John Glenn becomes the first American to orbit Earth aboard Friendship 7, following Alan Sheppard's suborbital flight the previous year aboard Freedom 7.
                    USSR's Voskhod programme included two crewed missions, sending five people in total, with Alexei Leonov performing the first spacewalk during the Voskhod 2 mission. 
                    Meanwhile, the American Gemini programme found success in performing space rendezvous (Gemini 6 and 7) and docking (Gemini 8), previously attempted during Vostok 3 and 4

                    The two powers were preparing to send people on the Moon.
                    The Soviet Union was again ahead with the Luna and Zond programmes.
                    Eventually, after an unfortunate setback and several gradual test missions, the USA succeeded and sent people on the moon with Apollo 11.
                    So far, USA has been the only country to send people there.

                    In 1971, the Soviet Union begins the first space station - Salyut 1.
                    The American response to the Salyut and later Almaz series was Skylab in 1973.
                    The space race reached a conclusion in 1975, when the two countries conducted a joint Apollo-Soyuz project where the two countries exchanged their own crew members in space.

                        In 1986, the Soviet Union launched the Mir programme to construct a modular space station.
                        The USA considered making their own modular space station, and the USSR was looking forward to a second Mir station.
                        After the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, however, the two sides (now Russia succeeding the USSR) announced that they will construct the International Space Station.
                        The ISS stands as the most prominent symbol of Earth orbit exploration and diplomacy.
                        Continuously inhabited since 2000, the ISS is a collaborative effort involving NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, and CSA, among others.
                        It serves as a unique laboratory for studying the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human body, testing new technologies, and conducting experiments in biology, physics, and materials science.

                        Beyond the ISS, Earth orbit is home to a diverse array of satellites and observatories.
                        Space telescopes like Hubble and James Webb have revolutionized our understanding of the Solar System and the <a href="universe.html">universe</a>.
                        Meanwhile, Earth observation satellites like Sentinel 1-6 monitor climate change, track natural disasters, and provide data essential for agriculture, urban planning, and environmental protection.
