                    Like other planets in the Solar System, the oldest Earth material dates back to 4.5 billion years.
                    It is believed that Earth was formed by a protoplanetary disc collapsing.
                    Million years after that, a protoplanet called Theia collided with Earth and formed the Moon in the process.

                    Earth's surface gradually cooled and a solid crust formed. 
                    Ice was brought by comets and other object, which turned into oceans by the volcanic activity.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Between four and three and a half billion years ago the first life forms appeared.
                    Multiple theories exist on how life on Earth formed.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Spontaneous spawning is an ancient theory, first mentioned by Aristotle.
                    According to him, lower life forms formed from decaying organic matter.
                    In 1668 Francesco Redi conducted an experiment, in which meat was left rotting, to see if maggots appeared, but none did, disproving the theory.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Another ancient theory dates back to Anaxagoras in the 5th century BC - Panspermia.
                    It states that life exist throughout the universe and was brought to Earth by <a href="comet.html">comets</a> and <a href="asteroid.html">asteroids</a>.
                    This theory does not mention how life formed, only the method it was carried to Earth.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 19th century several people proposed that life might have formed from inorganic compounds.
                    In 1924 Alexander Oparin and later in 1929 J. B. S. Haldane stated that the molecules constituting cells slowly self-organised from a so-called "primordial soup".
                    Chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey successfuly simulated such conditions in 1952.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Over the course of more than three billion years, life has evolved slowly, changing Earth's environment. 
                    Photosynthesizing life enriched the atmosphere with oxygen and multicellular organisms appeared. 
                    After the emergence of vertebrate organisms, fish quickly developed, and from them - the first amphibians evolved, which were the first to leave the oceans. 
                    There were many mass extinction, the most recent occuring 66 million years ago, when a massive asteroid wiped out most non-avian life and especially dinosaurs. 
                    Smaller mammals survived the impact and among those, apes gained abilities like upright standing and tool bearing. 
                    They are members of the class Homo, which evolved into the modern-day humans.

                        Summer occurs after the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere or the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere face the Sun.
                        Winter occurs at the same time at the opposite hemisphere.
                        These two positions of the Earth are calles solstices.
                        Equinoxes occur twice a year, when the Equator faces the Sun.
                        The axial tilt also creates two other circles - the Arctic and Antarctic circles.
                        Lands within each of them see the Sun one half of the year and experience a polar night the other half.
