                        10 Hygiea is the fourth largest <a href="asteroid.html">asteroid</a> in the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">asteroid belt</a>.
                        It is named after the Greek goddess of health and medicine.
                        Just like <a href="vesta.html">Vesta</a> and <a href="pallas.html">Pallas</a>, it is almost round in shape and is the closest to being an ellipsoid, apart from the already round <a href="ceres.html">Ceres</a>.
                        So far, it hasn't been visited by any probes, but it has been observed by the Very Large Telescope, similar to other large asteroids.

                    Hygiea was discovered by Annibale de Gasparis in 1849 at the Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte in Naples, Italy.
                    He was observing the ecliptic to catalogue <a href="star.html">stars</a> up to the 14th magnitude.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The asteroid is named after Hygiea, the Greek goddess of health.
                    This name was suggested by Ernesto Capocci Belmonte, friend and director of the Capodimonte Observatory
                    Meanwhile, while hearing the news of the discovery, astronomer John Herschel wrote a letter to several scientists in hopes that it reaches de Gasparis, in which he suggested the name Parthenope.
                    The reason is that the mythological Parthenope was a siren that is said to have founded the city of Naples, where Hygiea was discovered.
                    De Gasparis received the message after the name Hygiea was already accepted.
                    Nevertheless, the next asteroid de Gasparis discovered was 11 Parthenope, the name acknowledging Herschel's suggestion.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Hygiea is an outer main-belt asteroid with a semi-major axis of 3.14 AU.
                    It has an orbital period of 5.57 years and a rotational period of 13.8 hours.
                    The axis is highly tilted at 120° and thus it rotates in retrograde.
                    The orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11. and an inclination of 3.83°.
                    Hygiea is in a three-body mean motion orbital resonance with <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> and <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Hygiea is also the parent body of the Hygiea family, an asteroid family comprising over 7,000 known asteroids with similar orbital and compositional characteristics.
                    The other asteroids comprise only 2% of the total mass of the family and are likely fragments of a collision with Hygiea.

                    Hygiea has a mean diameter of 433 km, making it the fourth largest asteroid after Ceres, Vesta, and Pallas.
                    Similar to the latter two, it is almost round, but significant deviations from a spheroid result from Hygiea not being in hydrostatic equilibrium.
                    Of the three, it is the closest to an ellipsoid.

                    Hygiea is a C-type asteroid, characterized by a dark albedo and a composition rich in both silicates and carbonaceous material.
                    More precisely, it contains hydrated phylosilicates, graphite, carbonate minerals, and organic material.
                    It resembles CM chondrite meteorites.
                    The density of Hygiea has been calculated to be 2.06g/cm^3, suggesting a mostly rocky interior and little water ice.
                    Hygiea is likely differentiated like the other large asteroids.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    There are few large craters on the surface of Hygiea.
                    Imaging from the Very Large Telescope has shown only two distinct craters - Serpens and Calix, around 180 and 97 km in diameter respectively.
                    No other craters larger than 30 km have been identified, though there might be some less defined basins.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Hygiea has not been explored by a spacecraft.
                    However, there have been proposals of missions similar to the Dawn spacecraft.
