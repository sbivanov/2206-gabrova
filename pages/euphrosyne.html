                    Euphrosyne is part of a family that consists of about 2 000 known members.
                    One natural satellite has been discovered, measuring around 4 km in diameter and is likely also the result of the same collision.

                    Euphrosyne is a C-type asteroid, consisting of carbonaceous material.
                    Density measurements (1.7 g/cm^3) enabled by the moon of Euphrosyne show that the composition is also half ice.
