                        Sedna is a detached <a href="tno.html">trans-Neptunian object</a> and a potential <a href="dwarf-planet.html">dwarf planet</a>.
                        It is named after the Inuit goddess of the sea.
                        Sedna is a member of a group of objects known as sednoids, which have an eccentricity greater than 0.8 and a perihelion greater than 47.8 AU. 
                        It has been suggested that the sednoids suggest a possible ninth <a href="planet.html">planet</a> orbiting well beyond any discovered object in the <a href="solar-system.html">Solar System</a>.
                        The surface is red, due to the presence of tholins.
                        There are many volatiles present on the surface, but no methane has been detected.
                        Sedna has no known <a href="natural-satellite.html">moons</a>.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Sedna was discovered by the astronomers Michael Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David Rabinowitz on 14 November 2003 at the Palomar Observatory.
                    At the time, these three were searching for large objects beyond the orbit of <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>.
                    The reason for the search was due to the discovery of many new objects near <a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a>'s orbit, suggesting that there might be more, some as large as Pluto itself.
                    They found partial success with the discovery of <a href="quaoar.html">Quaoaor</a> the previous year.
                    Subsequent discoveries were the most intriguing for being as big as Pluto - <a href="eris.html">Eris</a>, <a href="haumea.html">Haumea</a>, and <a href="makemake.html">Makemake</a>.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Sedna was unique in that it had a very distant and extremely eccentric orbit.
                    This lead to the search for a new ninth planet, with Brown being the biggest proponent of this theory.

                    Sedna is named after the Inuit goddess of the sea.
                    The name was revealed by Brown before it was officially numbered, which was a violation of the protocol.
                    Still the name was approved.
                    The temporary nickname used for Sedna by Brown was "Flying Dutchman" for its slow movement.
                    Sedna has a minor planet number of 90377 and had a provisional name 2003 VB12.

                        Sedna is a trans-Neptunian object, located beyond the Kuiper belt.
                        It has a perihelion of 76.2 AU and an aphelion of 937 AU, thus the semi-major axis is 506 AU.
                        It takes 11 390 years to complete one orbit around the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>.
                        At the time of its discovery, Sedna was, and will be for a long time, near its perihelion, making it possible to observe with current technology.
                        It will reach perihelion in 2076.
                        Sedna has an inclination of 11.9° and an extreme eccentricity of 0.85.
                        The axial tilt is undeterminable as of yet, since Sedna has no known moons or rings.
                        Sedna completes one rotation every 10.3 hours.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The extreme eccentricity and distance of Sedna has lead to the establishment of a new subcategory of TNOs - sednoids.
                        So far, there are four such objects discovered - 2012 VP113, Leleākuhonua, and 2023 KQ14.
                        There have been efforts for the search of new sednoids, like the Palomar Distant Solar System Survey.
                        Although the survey was sensitive to movement out to 1,000 AU and discovered <a href="gonggong.html">Gonggong</a>, it detected no new sednoids (though it redetected Sedna).
                        In 2016, Brown, along with Konstantin Batygin, proposed that the clustering of the sednoids could be explained by the gravitational influence of an unseen "Planet Nine".
                        Their simulations showed that a planet with a mass of 5–10 <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> masses, an orbit averaging 400–800 AU from the Sun, and a highly elliptical and inclined orbit could explain the observed alignment and extreme orbits of the sednoids.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Since the hypothesis was proposed, astronomers have narrowed down the possible location and characteristics of Planet Nine.
                    The most likely orbit is highly elliptical, with a semi-major axis of about 260-320 AU, and an inclination of 6.8° ± 5°.
                    Size estimates suggest a diameter of 2–4 times that of Earth, making it a “super-Earth” or “mini-Neptune”, which exist in <a href="exoplanet.html">exoplanetary</a> systems.
                    However, some astronomers are still not convinced and suggest other theories, like observational bias.
                    Recent discoveries of objects like 2017 OF201 also challenge the hypothesis, since their orbits would be unstable if said Planet Nine exists.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Size estimates for Sedna are still not precise.
                    Current best fit models suggest a mean diameter of 906 km, with upper and lower limits between 1220 and 548 km.
                    A stellar occultation in 2013 showed chord lengths of 1025±135 km and 1025±135 km
                    The mass and the density have not been determined, since it has no moons to calculate it using Kepler's laws.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Sedna is likey differentiated and gravitationally rounded.
                    Since the density has not been determined, interior composition is yet unknown, but it is likely that it is similar to other large TNOs, mainly a rocky core and an icy mantle.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Sedna has a very red surface rich in tholins.
                    These complex organic compounds are the result of continuous radiation of methane-rich bodies reacting with nitrogen.
                    As objects like Sedna are too small to hold onto the nitrogen, only methane would remain onto the surface, along with the tholins.
                    JWST spectroscopic data has shown features of water, ethane, acetylene, ethylene, tholins, and possibly CO2.
                    The presence of numerous features attributable to ethane indicates a significant ethane abundance on its surface.
                    No nitrogen has been detected, as well as methane, though the latter might have into more complex hydrocarbons (particularly ethane).

                    Sedna has not been visited by a spacecraft.
                    In 2011, it was calculated that a flyby mission to Sedna could take 24.48 years using a <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> gravity assist, current technology, and launch dates of 6 May 2033 or 23 June 2046.
